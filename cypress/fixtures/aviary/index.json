But in the meantime, the health system is looking to upgrade its existing facilities.</p><p>“Many of my buildings need work,” Katz told lawmakers. “Elevators, aeration systems.

But just as those rules were supposed to take effect on January 1st, Gov. Kathy Hochul decided to give long-term care facilities some leeway.</p><p>The governor <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/executive-order/no-44-continuing-declaration-statewide-disaster-emergency-due-healthcare-staffing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued an executive order</a> on December 31st postponing enforcement of the rules for 30 days, citing a state of emergency she had declared due to a health care workforce shortage. At the time, the move seemed to be related to the omicron variant. COVID-19 cases had spiked in recent weeks, <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-hospital-staffing-crisis-is-fueled-by-omicron-made-worse-by-employee-departures\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exacerbating staffing issues</a> at hospitals and nursing homes.</p><p>But Hochul has since extended her executive order multiple times, most recently delaying enforcement of the rules, through the end of March.</p><p>Under the legislation, nursing homes are supposed to hire enough staff to provide patients with an average of three-and-a-half hours of clinical care each day. Patient advocates and labor unions say they are left wondering when nursing homes will actually have to staff up and comply. Studies have linked higher nursing home staffing levels to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7328494/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">better quality care</a> and even lower mortality rates.</p><p>“There is no reason to further postpone long-overdue reforms that hold nursing home operators accountable for ensuring adequate standards of care,” Milly Silva, executive vice president of 1199 SEIU, one of the unions that fought for the staffing legislation, said in a statement. “Residents, their families, caregivers and the tax-payers who fund this industry deserve better.”</p><p>Hochul’s office did not respond to a question from Gothamist this week about how long the governor intends to delay enforcement. The state health department said that even though non-compliance won’t be considered a violation of the law, “nursing homes are strongly encouraged to begin coming into compliance with these new requirements.”</p>",

The governor is also seeking to provide funding for certain health care workers to receive a one-time $3,000 bonus if they remain in their positions for at least a year.</p>",

They said that more of the required patient care hours should have to be provided by registered nurses, as opposed to support staff. But they are now emphasizing that it’s still an important first step.</p><p>“If the nursing homes say they don&#x27;t have enough staff, work with the state, work with the legislature and obtain more staff,” said Bill Ferris, the New York state legislative representative for AARP. “But don&#x27;t delay a measure that clearly helps the quality of life of a resident in a nursing home.”</p><p>State Senator Gustavo Rivera, who sponsored the nursing home staffing legislation, acknowledged that nursing homes were strained by employees leaving during the pandemic. But he said that was all the more reason for them to invest more of their revenue in complying with the regulations. “A crisis should not be exploited to the detriment of residents or staff in nursing homes,” Rivera said.</p>",

The former is a well-regarded columnist and cookbook author, the latter a journalist, TV personality (she was a judge on Top Chef) and founder of the iconic Farmer&#x27;s Market in the Tel Aviv Port, which has since branched out to other locations around the country. Eleven years ago Michal gave her mom a stall at the market to set up a sandwich shop called Sherry Herring, and people have been lining up for her Schmaltz and Matjes ever since.</p><p>Now the Anskys are in New York City, taking over a one-time hat store on West 72nd Street with their first Sherry Herring outside of Tel Aviv. The shop actually opened last fall, but, as the waggish sign in the window warned at the time, with &quot;No Sherry No Herring.&quot; Alex Benchimol, the restaurant&#x27;s general manager, explained to Gothamist that pandemic importation delays forced them to open without their two headliners. The fish has finally arrived, however, and Ansky herself will be here next week—so now Sherry Herring is finally up and running with its full cast.</p><p>Sandwiches dominate the proceedings here--&quot;it&#x27;s the essence of what Sherry Herring is in Israel,&quot; said Benchimol--led by two types of herring, Matjes and Schmaltz, both of which spend three months in Holland getting cured in salt water before they make their way into your baguette.</p>",

In the process of curing it, the Matjes, being smaller, becomes more buttery and saltier, whereas the Schmaltz is more meaty, has more of a bite, and is a little less salty.&quot;</p><p>I went with the Matjes, and the chunky fillets made for a big-flavored, wholly satisfying sandwich. It may not look like there&#x27;s a lot of fish on this beast, but even a little bit of herring packs a punch, and doesn&#x27;t get lost under the sour cream, onion, butter, scallions, chilis, and tomatoes. Another signature Sherry Herring selection, the housemade Smoked Tuna, also made for a memorable hero. Other sandwich stuffers include Smoked Sprats, Salted Anchovies, and Smoked Sardines, all served on baguettes from the nearby kosher bakery Patis.</p>",

No vodka shots like they pass around at the Tel Aviv shop, but you can get coffee and soft drinks.</p><p>So far the Sherry Herring team is loving their first New York City home. &quot;Herring is something that used to be very, very popular in the city,&quot; said Benchimol. &quot;We did some research and realized that back in the late 1800s, early 1900s, there were hundreds of herring shops in New York. You can still find a few places, but it&#x27;s much more unique at this point. And the Upper West Side is amazing—it&#x27;s very special when you have a small shop and people know you and wave at you and they&#x27;re really happy to have you here. You can feel it.&quot;</p>",

                            "value": "<p>It&#x27;s definitely been an eventful second career for chef Richard Chan. Born and raised in Singapore, Chan came to New York City in 1984, and spent more than thirty years running a travel business in Queens before selling the whole operation — complete with its fleet of buses — in 2017. And then he was finally able to pursue his true passion: cooking the foods of his beloved homeland.</p><p>The chef part of his life started out great, with a place called Yummy Tummy in Murray Hill, Queens, that became something of an instant hit after some early media attention. COVID was not kind to Yummy Tummy, however.</p><p>&quot;We were doing a lot of dining in, not a lot of takeout, so we were forced to close during the early days,&quot; Chan told Gothamist. &quot;When they reopened indoor dining, we were already behind by like six months in rent, so we negotiated with the landlord and gave up the premises.&quot;</p><p>But Chan did not give up, and in November of 2020 he opened the excellent<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/food/excellent-innovative-new-rice-rolls-stand-opens-flushing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Rolls Rice</a> in a Flushing food court, specializing in what he called &quot;modern, untraditional rice rolls.&quot; The location wasn&#x27;t quite right for the concept though, said Chan, so when a space became available in the Queens Crossing Mall, he leapt at the opportunity. Maybe a bit too fast.</p><p>&quot;The initial idea was to move Rolls Rice over here and expand our menu,&quot; said Chan. &quot;Unfortunately, after we signed a lease and moved here, the building didn&#x27;t let us extend our venting hood, so we couldn&#x27;t feed our steamer into the equipment, and had to give up Rolls Rice.&quot;</p><p>And now, after all that, we have Sin Kee, Chan&#x27;s third restaurant in as many years, and this time the chef is focusing on Singapore&#x27;s legendary hawker fare.</p><p>A pair of entree-sized birds lead the way, with top billing going to Chan&#x27;s Hainanese Chicken Rice, &quot;the national dish of Singapore.&quot; The chicken here is slow-poached, skin left on, poured over with broth and served at room temperature, gizzards and spicy pickles on the side. It&#x27;s delicious.</p><p>Also very good is the funky Teochew Braised Duck, sticky with dark soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and star anise. This comes with chunks of soaked-through tofu and tons of SK taro rice. Chan said he will follow tradition and reuse Sin Kee&#x27;s braising liquid, giving it more and more depth of flavor after each use.</p><p>“In Singapore some places have been using the same broth for 60 or 70 years,” he said. “I don’t intend to use it for quite that long here in America, plus I’d be 149.&quot;</p>",

The Singapore Satay is generously portioned as well, with a half dozen skewers of fat, heavily-seasoned hunks of pork or beef (or both) served in an insulated bag. Definitely get Chan&#x27;s thick, fiery peanut sambal with these.</p><p>Chan also plays around with other regional flavors, in dishes such as Thai Lemongrass Popcorn Chicken; Tawainese Guo Bac, a pork belly and mustard greens bun; and H.K. Faux Shark Fin Soup. Sibel Crunchy Fries with chili crab sauce, Fried Fishball Skewers, and deep-fried SK Bacon Bites round out your snack options, and for dessert, you can get a tub of pandan-flavored BoBo ChaCha, a coconut milk soup of sorts thick with sweet potato and taro chunks. Chan said he expects to receive his liquor license soon, but housemade non-boozy drinks like Barley Lime and Purple Tea are available in the meantime.</p><p>Sin Kee is set somewhat apart from its Queens Crossing Mall food court neighbors, with what amounts to a separate entrance on 138th Street, though all the seating throughout the sprawling space is communal, so you can grab a table wherever.</p>",

Even though you have high taxes, you have a hugely disproportionate share of billionaires, and you have the same story in California, the state with the highest taxes,” Saez said. “You can say we’ve reached the tipping point, but I don’t see how that squares with data.”</p><p>Billionaires don’t accrue money like millionaires do, with jobs as high paying professionals or executives. Saez estimates that nearly <a href=\"https://taxjusticenow.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">half of the wealth of billionaires</a> is made up of unrealized capital gains—essentially unsold stock—which billionaires can borrow against to raise vast sums of money, but isn’t taxed until it is actually sold.

You become a Florida resident for a year, and that’s where you sell your Bloomberg LP business, that is actually sitting in New York. Because you are now a Florida resident, you don’t pay income tax to New York, and therefore you escape the New York tax on realized capital gains.”</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8277\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">language of the proposed billionaire’s tax</a> directs the state to determine how much those unrealized capital gains have increased in market value since the billionaire has been a New Yorker, and then tax that increase in value at the standard top income tax rate—8.8%—and repeat the process every year.

And I do mean blow it up,” he said.</p><p>Shaviro thinks the billionaire’s tax proposal would pass state constitutional muster, but that one provision in the constitution—”Undistributed profits shall not be taxed”—gave him pause, because one could argue that could refer to unrealized capital gains.</p><p>“It really looks like this is income and it’s just restricted to a particular tier of people,” he said. “But the last sentence I’d have to think about. What does this mean? Is this a problem or not?”</p><p>As a matter of tax policy, Shaviro said that targeting billionaires makes sense.</p><p>“We have extreme wealth inequality in the country, and we have great fiscal needs. And for me that makes it desirable, subject to administrative and prudential concerns, to require this tier to pay more because they’re doing so well,” he said. “It doesn’t mean they’re bad people or anything, it’s just that they’re in an enormously favorable position, and the whole society is better off if they contribute more.”</p><p>Shaviro added, “If we lived in an alternative universe where we imagined, piece by piece, it was all going to be extirpated away from them you’d be a little more worried. But I really don’t think that’s the world we live in. I don’t think this, except in hysterically overheated imaginations, puts us on a path to that sort of thing.”</p><p>Carmen De La Rosa, who is sponsoring the billionaire’s tax in the state Assembly, called it “a small sacrifice for long term success of New York&#x27;s economy.”</p><p>“They&#x27;re working, they&#x27;re delivering food, they&#x27;re keeping our city running,&quot; she said. “They&#x27;re people who are essential every single day.

That’s what happened after the 2008 economic crash caused delays in Hudson Yards’ initial construction schedule: New York City <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/as-hudson-yards-refinances-old-debt-need-for-nearly-100-million-in-additional-funding-emerges-as-costs-continue-to-exceed-plan.html#:~:text=The%20city%20last%20made%20an,and%20%2465%20million%20for%202021).\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">provided $359 million in “interest support payments”</a> through 2015 to shore up HYIC’s finances. And though those payments were <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/on-the-far-west-side-citys-hudson-yards-interest-subsidies-reduced-in-near-term-yet-future-subsidies-remain-may-2016.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reduced or eliminated</a> in recent years thanks to better-than-expected Hudson Yards revenues, the city remains on the hook if things take a turn for the worse.</p><p>And for the worse is where things seem headed, at least in the short term. Most of the air-rights payments and zoning bonus fees have mostly already been pocketed, leaving the PILOTs (and Tax Equivalency Payments, or TEPs, the residential-building equivalent of PILOTs) to make up the difference as the site is fully built out and rented. If that doesn’t happen because the Manhattan economy has undergone a seismic shift, those subway debt payments could run out of funding.</p><p>“The city’s investment in Hudson Yards has always been designed so that the debt for the train was most reliant on the commercial tax payments,” says Fisher. So if mall receipts tank and offices remain vacant, that’s bad news not just for the project’s private developer, The Related Companies, but also for the city’s finances.</p>",

Hudson Yards has inherent advantages because it was created as a live-work-play neighborhood where people benefit from unified health protocols, state-of-the-art cleaning and air filtration and safety measures.”</p><p>If state-of-the-art cleaning isn’t enough to restore Hudson Yards’ shine in a post-COVID Manhattan, how much it will cost the city when the music stops is anyone’s guess. Fisher notes that the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation’s <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hyic/downloads/hyic-budget-2021.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">latest budget</a>, approved in May 2020, doesn’t include any accounting for the economic effects of the pandemic that was then in full swing. A person who answered the HYIC phone line but declined to give their name told Gothamist, “The last time we did the budget was probably a few months ago, and there’s really been no change.”</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, if Hudson Yards tanks along with a weakening demand for Midtown space, the city will have bigger problems on its hands. City tax losses from falling tax payments across the entire five boroughs could be $14 billion over the years 2020 through 2022, according to <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/covid-19-toll-on-the-local-economy-a-preliminary-estimate-of-job-losses-and-tax-revenue-declines-april-2020.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an April IBO forecast</a>. And though most of that is due to lower income- and sales-tax receipts during the time when no one is working or spending money, not property taxes, falling property valuations could be the longest-lasting effect.</p><p>But even if Hudson Yards losses only add to a deepening sea of red ink for the city, critics of the project say that’s all the more reason to question the logic of spending $3 billion on a bet that what New York City most needed was a new Midtown annex with its own upscale mall.</p><p>“The main point here is that the city took on enormous risks in how they decided to structure their Hudson Yards investment, with taxpayers ultimately footing the bill if and when anything goes wrong,” says Fisher. “When the economy was booming, the city came in and paid an additional $2.2 billion to open the project. Now when the economy is in crisis, it’s likely we’re going to have to do so again.”</p>",

The NYPD contends the increase reflects efforts to report more accurately.</p><p>Christopher Dunn, the legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, calls the numbers “suspiciously low,” especially given that there are 22,000 police officers and sergeants—officers who are most likely to perform stops.</p><p>“When you look at the history of stop activity in the NYPD, even though they&#x27;ve come way, way, down from the highs of the Bloomberg years, these numbers are not believable.”</p><p>What’s more, the racial disparities of the stops haven’t budged. In 2019, 88 percent of people stopped were black and Latino. That’s up from 85 percent in 2013, when a federal judge ruled that the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional.</p><p>Among the stops reported by the NYPD last year, 35 percent resulted in an arrest or summons, a potential—though not certain—sign of improvement in police officers’ use of the tactic. In contrast, for example, just 12 percent of 4.4 million stops resulted in an arrest or summons over an eight-year period of stop-and-frisk under Bloomberg.</p><p>Still, the monitor has not deemed the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practices to be in compliance with the Constitution, and the police department is likely to be under the monitor’s watch for years to come.</p>",

As of June 2019, the police department had <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nearly-2000-complaints-of-nypd-racial-profiling-since-2014mdashand-the-department-found-nothing-wrong\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">failed to substantiate</a> a single claim.

And I think for all of those reforms the publicly available data shows that they have a long way to go.”</p><p>There are crucial policies that have not even been finalized on paper, Charney added, such as a new discipline protocol for officers who make unconstitutional stops in cases substantiated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board.</p><p>And what Charney and other legal advocates at the table are seeking is more reporting from the monitor on the fundamental question of whether stops are lawful and free of racial bias.</p><p>Dunn, the NYCLU legal director, says the lack of a more meaningful analysis on constitutionality has been frustrating. Dunn serves as counsel on one of the three cases in the federal monitorship, and has been closely involved in the reform process.</p><p><i>“</i>Is race still playing a role in stops? There is no monitor reporting about that yet and we are in 2020,” Dunn said. <i>“</i>And the other related issue is, even setting aside racial bias—are stops legal in terms of officers having the required reasonable suspicion? Again, there is no meaningful monitoring reporting yet about whether or not the department is complying with that legal requirement.”</p>",

Indeed, in Scheindlin’s original court orders, the judge noted that the people most affected by stop-and-frisk must perceive the reforms as legitimate in order for them to be successful.</p><p>“Neither an independent Monitor, nor a municipal administration, nor this Court can speak for those who have been and will be most affected by the NYPD’s use of stop-and-frisk,” Scheindlin wrote.</p><p>Community groups took part in a lengthy community engagement process, as ordered by Scheindlin, which resulted in <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2018/05/Dkt%20593%20-%20JRP%20Final%20Report%205-15-18%20ECF.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a> for 14 additional reforms. The judge now presiding over the remediation phase of the stop-and-frisk case, Analisa Torres, has ordered a version of three of them.</p><p>But Kang says at least two of the most crucial recommendations have not yet been ordered: stronger disciplinary measures and a “community oversight board” to help guide the reform process.</p><p>“The theory of change around this case was always that if there wasn&#x27;t a strong disciplinary response and if there wasn&#x27;t a strong community oversight mechanism, that it wouldn&#x27;t be successful,” she said.</p><p>It is entirely possible that the court will order more changes in the future, according to those working closely on the reform work. And there is a sense that the monitorship is not coming to an end any time soon.</p><p><i>“</i>I think it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s going to go on for years,” Dunn said.</p>",

Hours earlier, an audio recording of him crudely defending stop and frisk had surfaced online. “Put a lot of cops” in &quot;minority neighborhoods&quot; to address murder rates, <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/bloomberg-backlash-stop-frisk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he told an Aspen Institute crowd</a> in 2015, and “throw them against the wall.” Amid widespread backlash, Bloomberg summoned his allies in the faith community to a private meeting at his Times Square headquarters.</p><p>Their conversation was reportedly “genuine” but “not hostile,” and culminated in a joint statement attributed to eighteen black clergy members affirming that “none of us believe that Mike Bloomberg is a racist.” The campaign <a href=\"https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/african-american-faith-leaders-respond-to-donald-trumps-attack-on-mike-bloomberg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">distributed the message of support</a> to the press just as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganizingPower/status/1227748676455608326\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> of another controversial Bloomberg comment — this time showing him linking the financial crisis to the elimination of a discriminatory housing policy — began ricocheting around the internet, drawing a fresh round of condemnation.</p><p>Explaining his continued loyalty to Bloomberg, Reverend Calvin Butts, the pastor at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/13/bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-114755\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told Politico</a>: “He used his money, which is one of the reasons I continue to support him, to express his sincerity.”</p><p>Three days later, as worshipers poured into Sunday mass at the historic Gothic building on 138th Street where Butts has long preached, many expressed misgivings about the influential minister giving his stamp of approval to Bloomberg.</p><p>“He shouldn’t be endorsing anyone on the church’s behalf,” said Jerome Jackson, a 63-year-old Harlem resident and congregant at Abyssinian. “I do not think most of the people here agree with those statements.&quot;</p><p>Like several other churchgoers, Jackson suggested that Butt’s support for the billionaire candidate was based on political and financial opportunism. “He’s had his palms greased before,” said Jackson, referencing the pastor’s <a href=\"https://www.villagevoice.com/1998/10/27/the-sins-of-reverend-calvin-butts/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">endorsement</a> of Republican governor George Pataki in 1998 and Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama in 2008. Following Pataki&#x27;s victory, Butts was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/07/nyregion/pastor-of-harlem-church-nominated-to-head-suny-at-old-westbury.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appointment by a governor-controlled board</a> as president of SUNY Old Westbury, where he took home a recent salary of $246,684, according to public records.</p><p>Other congregants said their pastor’s endorsement of Bloomberg had no bearing on their personal feelings about the candidate. “Don&#x27;t like him, won&#x27;t vote for him,” said Thomasine, a retired NYC public school teacher, who declined to share her last name. “Bloomberg was terrible on education. [Butts] has his own issues. I was in the church before he came, so that’s fine.”</p><p></p><p>A request to interview Reverend Butts was declined on Sunday, and the church did not respond to a request for comment on this story.</p>",

In 2009, the <i>Times</i> analyzed<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/nyregion/29ministers.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> the web of ties between Bloomberg and black clergy</a>, forged through “an unusual combination of city money, private philanthropy, political appointments and personal attention.” While seeking a third term, Bloomberg cut a $1 million check to the Abyssinian&#x27;s development corporation, earning him Butts’s endorsement over Bill Thompson, the NYC comptroller to whom the reverend had previously pledged his support.</p><p>Ahead of his late entrance into the presidential race, Bloomberg, who’s worth an estimated $60 billion, seems to have broadened the scope of this politically strategic philanthropy. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/15/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-spending.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Recent reporting shows</a> that the $3.3 billion he spent on charitable giving in 2019 — a sum higher than he gave in the previous five years combined — has bought him favor among prominent groups, like Emily’s List, whose leaders were troubled by Bloomberg&#x27;s remarks <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/us/politics/bloomberg-president-2020-democrat.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">questioning the veracity of allegations</a> emerging from the #MeToo movement.</p><p>At least some of those donations seems to have translated into the backing of high-ranking black leaders. After announcing his endorsement last week, New York Congressman Gregory Meeks said Sunday that he’d <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/02/17/rep-gregory-meeks-interview-bloomberg-erica-hill-nr-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">overcome concerns about Bloomberg’s policing legacy</a> because he “put his money where his mouth is.”</p><p>But some Harlem residents say they’re not willing to forgive the former mayor quite so easily.</p><p>“I&#x27;ve been stopped and frisked. My daughter has been stopped and frisked. My daughter&#x27;s friends have been stopped and frisked,” said Tobius Simmons, a security guard at Williams Institutional CME, a Methodist Episcopal church a few blocks south of Abyssinian. “So he&#x27;s had a negative impact on quality of life for most working-class people around here.”</p><p>“The things that come out of his mouth about certain segments of society — he&#x27;s unaware and arrogant,” Simmons continued. He cited Bloomberg’s lengthy history of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/the-portable-bloomberg-the-wit-wisdom-of-michael-bloomberg/ba5281b4-886d-42dc-a28d-e67eceb60719/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">misogynistic comments</a>, including his labeling of federal Judge Shira Scheindlin, who ruled stop and frisk unconstitutional, as <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/mike-sorry-bloomberg-used-argue-nypd-stopped-white-people-too-much\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“some woman.”</a></p><p>A Jill Stein supporter in 2016, Simmons said he was leaning toward Senator Bernie Sanders in the next election, but had largely lost faith in the political establishment. “The Democrats don’t have a vision. At least the Republicans have a vision. They&#x27;re willing to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">put pedophiles in office</a> so they can get more white judges in the south — that&#x27;s a vision!” he declared.</p><p>As Biden’s poor performance in Iowa and New Hampshire has left the Democrats&#x27; moderate lane up for grabs, Bloomberg has seen his prospects begin to rise. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/politics/bloomberg-debate-poll-numbers.html?emc=edit_na_20200218&amp;ref=cta&amp;nl=breaking-news&amp;campaign_id=60&amp;instance_id=0&amp;segment_id=21366&amp;user_id=d3640cc13e8e65c34eec532bf146dc2d&amp;regi_id=15094810\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A new national poll</a> from NPR, PBS NewsHour, and Marist shows Bloomberg polling in second place behind Sanders.</p><p>Multiple people who spoke to Gothamist on Sunday morning said they were waiting to throw their support behind the candidate who had the best chance of success in November, even if that meant voting for someone with whom they strongly disagreed.</p><p>“Stop and frisk was a serious, serious negative policy. But you know, he’s better than Trump. So I think people are grappling with that,” said Desmond West, a New Rochelle resident, as he hurried into mass on Sunday.</p><p>Ms. Harris, an Abyssinian churchgoer who declined to share her first name, said she disliked Bloomberg, but remained undecided about who she’ll vote for when the New York primary rolls around on April 28th. “The things that have taken place against this community, [Bloomberg] didn&#x27;t really apologize for them in the way that we thought he should,” Harris said. “It wasn&#x27;t quite sincere.”</p><p>“But he definitely has more values than our current president,” she added. “So I don’t know. I really just want to get behind someone strong enough to actually win.”</p>",

I personally wouldn&#x27;t grab a dog&#x27;s snout, nor try to shake it like a hand, unless they were basically family (and even then, I might pause to consider whether the dog might prefer an ear scratch first). And &quot;muzzle grabs&quot; are particularly frowned upon. <a href=\"https://pethelpful.com/dogs/Understanding-Muzzle-Grabs-in-Dogs\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As PetHelpful wrote</a>, dogs&#x27; roughhousing is different from humans doing it, and generally reinforces bad and dangerous behavior: &quot;When we apply muzzle grabs to dogs, we teach them that hands are bad and that biting is the best way to keep them away. This is why I often get cases of nipping dogs that don&#x27;t want hands anywhere near their faces and puppies that never learn to stop biting.&quot;</p>",

Though Bloomberg is running as a Democrat, he struck a nonpartisan chord in front of a crowd with a sizable number of Republicans.</p><p>“I’ve always thought the president of the United States should be the leader of the entire country, not the leader of a political party,” Bloomberg said, netting his most significant applause line. “We need to bring this country together and I know we can do that.”</p><p>Bloomberg pitched himself as a pragmatist who could, unlike any other politician existing today, defy the polarization of Washington. “All I know is that I’ve spent my career bringing people together to tackle big problems,” he said. “I know it can work in Washington as well.”</p><p>Though he ran three times for mayor as a Republican, Bloomberg is now competing as a Democrat, setting up an <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/mike-bloombergs-ymbiotic-relationship-nys-gop-we-agreed-him-so-many-issues?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=shared_twitter\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">odd contrast</a> with the rest of the left-leaning field. The billionaire is skipping the early voting states, hoping to vault into contention by spending massive amounts of his own cash in larger states that vote later next year. He has already spent close to $40 million on a TV blitz across America. On Wednesday, he announced a new wave of advertising spending, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/fe4ef751a4aeddb6ca5555e231fae7ce\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly for a comparable amount of money.</a></p><p>Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">significantly trails</a> three of the leading candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, in the polls. Warren, a progressive, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1202332303638323201\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">took direct aim at Bloomberg</a> by running an advertisement on his own TV station, denouncing the billionaire for trying to “buy” the election.</p><p>Back home, Bloomberg may have picked up his first local endorsement last night—from Dr. Mohamed Khalid, the longtime president of the Iron Hills Civic Association, the group that hosted Bloomberg on Wednesday. Dr. Khalid, who called Bloomberg a “great man,” proclaimed Staten Island would “help him win the White House.”</p><p>There was a light smattering of boos in the ballroom when Dr. Khalid took a jab at President Donald Trump, who is a popular figure on Staten Island. “In my opinion, the country needs [Bloomberg] right now because I’ll tell you he’s everything that our current president is not,” the civic leader said.</p><p>After Dr. Khalid’s introduction, Bloomberg spoke for a little over ten minutes, ticking off a range of achievements during his 12 years as mayor: reducing crime and incarceration rates, combating gun violence, cutting New York’s carbon footprint, boosting job growth, and opening a major park at the former Great Kills landfill. Though Bloomberg said he supported the constitutional right to own a gun, he also reminded the crowd he founded a prominent national organization, <a href=\"https://everytown.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Everytown for Gun Safety</a>, to fight for stiffer gun control laws.</p><p>“I’m going to run for president of the United States because I know we can do exactly the same things we did in New York City across this entire country,” Bloomberg said.</p><p>As a Republican, Bloomberg carried conservative Staten Island in all three mayoral elections. For each campaign, he held his kickoff event in the city’s smallest borough. Early in his tenure, he recalled visiting the Staten Island hospital where two NYPD detectives were taken after <a href=\"https://www.silive.com/news/2013/07/from_2003_emergency_workers_tr.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">suffering fatal gunshot wounds.</a></p><p>The well-dressed crowd was receptive to Bloomberg, though it’s unclear how representative of the Democratic electorate they will be. “Out of all the Democrats, he’s a good guy,” said Connie Mauro, a Republican who said she would consider voting for Bloomberg over Trump. “When he was mayor, you weren’t afraid to go out at night.”</p><p>State Senator Diane Savino, a Staten Island Democrat who has yet to endorse a candidate, watched Bloomberg deliver his speech. A lawmaker who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/02/04/idc-survivors-making-peace-with-those-who-opposed-them-835748\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">once partnered with Republicans</a> in the State Senate, Savino called Bloomberg an “interesting development” in the race.</p><p>“If we don’t have a viable candidate who can appeal to the middle of the road Democrat as well as moderate Republicans, we’re going to end up with Donald Trump again,” she said. “I’m open to hearing to what he has to say.”</p>",

Tourist Karen Town from Georgia already knows who he is. She was at Grand Central Terminal with a friend on Sunday.</p><p>“We like him and we just feel like there haven&#x27;t been any candidates, at least who we&#x27;ve been sympathetic to, who have any charisma. For us that&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ve been missing in the Democratic race,” she said.</p><p>Town said even though she&#x27;s ready for a progressive President, such as Bernie Sanders, she thinks the rest of the country is looking for a moderate, such as Bloomberg.</p><p>But it may be difficult for Bloomberg to win over some local voters, as the mayor who pushed the controversial policing practice called stop-and-frisk, and <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/mike-sorry-bloomberg-used-argue-nypd-stopped-white-people-too-much\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">staunchly defended it</a>.</p><p>“Yeah I don&#x27;t like him because of that,” said Dan Wilson of Westchester County. “I think now he&#x27;s just trying to admit that it was wrong, just to secure votes.”</p><p>Last week, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/bloomberg-apologizes-stop-and-frisk-he-embarks-presidential-run\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apologized for stop-and-frisk at a black church</a> in East New York, Brooklyn, saying the tactic eroded trust. Police made millions of stops in the name of getting guns off the street, but no weapons were found in the vast majority of cases. Black and Latino men in low income neighborhoods were mostly affected by the aggressive form of policing. A judge later found the stops <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/federal-judge-stop-frisk-violates-us-constitution\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to be unconstitutional</a>.</p><p>Political analyst Christina Greer said that as a presidential candidate, Bloomberg needs to confront, not just stop-and-frisk, but also the lack of diversity in his companies. </p><p>“That’s not just racial and ethnic diversity but also gender diversity and promotions,” the Fordham University political science professor said. “In an era of #MeToo he’s going to have to account for that in a substantive way, in ways that he just did not have to in the past.”</p><p>But Greer also said Bloomberg’s formidable wealth cannot be discounted.</p><p>“I know that Michael Bloomberg says he’d only spend $100 million but keep in mind he spent <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/bloomberg-spent-102-million-on-campaign\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$100 million to become Mayor of New York City</a> and that was roughly almost twenty years ago,” she said. </p><p>Bloomberg is entering the presidential race as a Democrat just 10 weeks before primary voting begins. He’ll skip the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary in February, and target delegate-heavy <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Super_Tuesday_primaries,_2020\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Super Tuesday</a> in March, when primaries in 15 jurisdictions take place.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/people/cindy-rodriguez/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Cindy Rodriguez</i></a> <i>is an investigative reporter for New York Public Radio.

By <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2013/06/29/bloomberg_thinks_nypd_stops-and-fri.php\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">invoking statistics</a> that show that people of color commit and are affected by crime at higher proportions than whites, <i>of course</i> they are stopped at higher proportions than white people, the story went, because the NYPD targets crime, not race. (Almost <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/happy_5_millionth_stop_and_frisk_ny.php\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">90 percent of people stopped during the Bloomberg administration were black or Hispanic</a> men. The vast majority—around 88 percent of the 4.4 million stops from 2004 through 2012—were innocent of any crime.)</p><p>“And the numbers put the lie to the racist allegations,” Bloomberg said in a speech in the spring of 2013, as the federal class action lawsuit against stop and frisk was playing out in court. “In fact, the percentage of stops of blacks is less than that of whites and Asians when adjusted for crime reports.”</p><p>But in a radio interview that summer, after the City Council passed two NYPD oversight bills, Bloomberg <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2013/06/29/bloomberg_thinks_nypd_stops-and-fri.php\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was more explicit</a>.</p><p>&quot;I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little.

The numbers don&#x27;t lie,” Bloomberg said.</p><p>But using statistics to justify racial profiling is still racial profiling. The federal judge in the case, Justice Shira Scheindlin, made this observation to a City lawyer defending the practice during the nine-week trial in the spring of 2013:</p>",

(Roughly <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">half</a> of those stopped by police were between the ages of 14 and 24.) Bloomberg saw his opening and took it.</p><p>&quot;It is the parents&#x27; job to start a stop-and-frisk in the home, to the extent that they can,” Bloomberg replied. &quot;We in the city are doing everything we can to work with our young kids, for those who&#x27;ve fallen off the right path, to get them back on track.&quot;</p><p><b>That Time Bloomberg Compared Stop And Frisk Opponents To The NRA</b></p><p>The <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/our-cases/floyd-et-al-v-city-new-york-et-al\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, along with the New York Civil Liberties Union, led the charge against the City in the federal stop and frisk litigation.</p><p>“Let’s be clear, the NYCLU’s priority is not protecting our safety.

Both groups, I think, are dangerously wrong on the Constitution.”</p><p>Bloomberg added, “The right to bear arms and the right to privacy do not trump the right of citizens to walk down their own street, or walk down their own hallway, without getting blown away. You’d think that would be common sense!”</p>",

Speaking at the<a href=\"https://www.cccinfo.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Christian Cultural Center,</a> a large black church in East New York, Bloomberg said thinking about his future made him think about his past. He said, during his administration, he hadn&#x27;t fully understood the impact stop-and-frisk had on black and Latino communities. For that, he said he&#x27;s sorry.</p><p>&quot;I got something important wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;I got something important really wrong.&quot;</p><p>It was the former mayor&#x27;s first public speech since filing paperwork to be on the ballot in the Alabama and Arkansas primaries. The speech was less than 12 minutes, and Bloomberg led into his apology by ticking off what he considered his administration&#x27;s achievements in criminal justice. In the early years, he said, his administration succeeded in reducing murders and improving relationships with police, including by diversifying the police force. He said at the end of his term polling showed that black New Yorkers approved of the job the police were doing. </p><p>&quot;That was a real point of pride for me,” he said.</p><p>By the time he left office, however, that support had declined sharply, mostly because of stop-and-frisk, . Studies consistently<a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/212460-city-teenagers-say-stop-and-frisk-all-about-race-and-class/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> showed</a> black and Latino kids were overwhelmingly stopped by police. But, until now, Bloomberg has vigorously defended the policy.</p><p>When a <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/federal-judge-stop-frisk-violates-us-constitution\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">federal judge ruled in 2013</a> that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional, Bloomberg<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/six-bogus-things-bloomberg-said-about-stop-frisk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appealed the decision</a>. That same year, then-mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio emphasized his empathy with parents of black children who were afraid of the police. An <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasios-first-tv-ad-stars-his-well-coiffed-son-dante\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ad featuring de Blasio&#x27;s son Dante,</a> who says his father was &quot;the only one who will stop a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color,&quot; helped propel him to Gracie Mansion. </p><p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t get everything right. We did make mistakes. I made mistakes,&quot; Bloomberg said to the congregation on Sunday. &quot;Our main focus was saving lives. The fact is far too many people were being stopped while we tried to do that. And the overwhelming majority of them were black and Latino. And that may have included, I&#x27;m sorry to say, some of you here today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I realize back then I was wrong, and I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; he said. <i>(See his apology below;</i> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_wj8hTM15I\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>full video here</i></a><i>.)</i></p><p></p>",

But Sharpton said it will take more to make up for the damage done to communities of color. </p><p>&quot;I am glad to see Mr. Bloomberg now admit that the policy was wrong,&quot; he wrote in a statement. &quot;He called me after his speech and I communicated to him that it will take more than one speech for people to forgive and forget a policy that so negatively impacted entire communities. However, I’m glad to see his position vocalized at a time when President Trump is calling for stop-and-frisk nationally.&quot;</p><p>Patrick J. Lynch, president of the police union, the Police Benevolent Association, said officers had told Bloomberg long ago that the &quot;emphasis on street stops&quot; was &quot;polluting&quot; relationships with communities. </p><p>&quot;His administration&#x27;s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;The apology is too little too late.&quot;</p><p>Mayor de Blasio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1196130583409283072\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted a similar sentiment</a>, saying the apology was &quot;long overdue&quot; and the timing &quot;cynical.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said stop-and-frisk was &quot;just one of many&quot; Bloomberg administration policies with a &quot;detrimental impact on lower income New Yorkers and communities of more color.&quot; Williams pointed to housing and education among other areas that merited more reflection from the former mayor.</p><p>The New York Civil Liberties, one of the parties that <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/bloomberg-when-it-comes-to-stop-and-frisk-nyclu-no-better-than-nra\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sued the city</a> over stop-and-frisk, expressed a similar sentiment about the policy’s legacy. The group’s executive director, Donna Lieberman said the city’s current “broken windows” approach to policing minor crimes continues to rely on stop and frisk.</p><p>“[It] is not a remnant of New York’s past. It is a daily reality for many New Yorkers,” Lieberman said in a statement. “What New Yorkers need to hear is a plan to end police violence and restore trust between officers and communities.”</p><p><br/><a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/people/jessica-gould/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Jessica Gould</i></a> <i>is a reporter in the newsroom at WNYC.

(“The couple of days a week before I need to get my hair colored,” Quinn once said, “he’ll say, ‘Do you pay a lot to make your hair be two colors? Because now it’s three with the gray.’”) Bloomberg mocking Quinn again, she said, for failing to wear heels at public events. (“I was at a parade with him once and he said, ‘What are those?’ and I said, ‘They’re comfortable,’ and he said, ‘I never want to hear those words out of your mouth again.’”) Bloomberg, quoted by colleagues as saying, “If women wanted to be appreciated for their brains, they’d go to the library instead of to Bloomingdale’s.” Bloomberg being asked in a deposition, “Have you ever made a comment to the effect that you would like to ‘do that piece of meat,’ or I’d ‘do her in a second’?” Bloomberg replying, “I don’t recall ever using the term meat at all.”"

(\"Hudson Yards\" is widely used to mean both the smaller development and the larger area; also, both the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hyic/index.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation</a> [HYIC], which is a public entity, and <a href=\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/about/our-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Related Hudson Yards</a>, which is a private developer.

Caemmerer West Side Yard, an open-cut rail yard taking up six city blocks west of Penn Station, officially opened in 1987, on the site of a rail depot that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/26/archives/at-the-hudson-river-railroad-depot-the-obsequies-inside-the-depot.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dated back to the Civil War</a>. With the Javits Convention Center having debuted one year earlier on the northern part of the yards, this land was soon eyed as well for possible future development:  Rudy Giuliani considered it for the site of <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-01/sports/sp-40929_1_yankee-stadium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a proposed Yankees stadium</a> — a plan killed by the city council in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/29/nyregion/city-council-sues-giuliani-over-charter-commission.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a rare budget revolt</a> — and it was targeted by the Jets owners for a new football and Olympic stadium — <a href=\"http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2005/06/06/1044/jets-stadium-gets-the-silver-bullet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nixed by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver</a> after Madison Square Garden owner James Dolan <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/84249-cablevision-and-msg-spent-30m-to-lobby-against-stadium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hired Silver's former chief of staff as a lobbyist</a>. (One legacy of the latter proposal: the Jets’ stadium czar at the time was Jay Cross, who ended up jumping to Related to head up its own development plans.)</p><p>Before the NFL plan met its demise, it shook loose an important concession from the city council, which approved spending $2 billion to extend the 7 train to 33rd Street and 11th Avenue. New subway lines are usually the responsibility of the MTA, but that authority wanted nothing to do with spending $2 billion to add a single station. Instead, Michael Bloomberg's deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff came up with a plan dubbed \"value capture\": The city would take tax money collected on the site and siphon it off to pay off the cost of the subway extension and traffic infrastructure, with the goal of making the site more attractive to developers who could create an entire new neighborhood on the failed stadium site.  </p><p>The value that would have to be captured was daunting. To foot the bill, the city redirected a dizzying array of revenue streams to the newly created Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation, a quasi-public agency controlled by, but not technically part of, the city. </p><p>According to figures compiled by the NYC Independent Budget Office, these are (deep breath): $814.4 million from district improvement bonuses, fees paid by developers for exceeding existing zoning limits; $414.9 million from \"tax equivalency payments,\" residential property taxes funneled to the HYIC; $294.1 million from the resale of those air rights that had purchased from the MTA; and $145.4 million from payments in lieu of property and mortgage recording taxes on commercial properties. The City has also kicked in $281.2 million from its capital budget for items like sewers, $75.5 million for <a href=\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/the-shed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a performing arts center with retractable walls dubbed The Shed</a>, and $55.4 million in 7 train cost overruns. </p><p>Money spent so far isn't the best way of looking at the split of costs, though. Since the air rights money and zoning bonuses have mostly run their course, the vast majority of the funds will come from future property tax revenues — or payments in lieu of waived property taxes — from a quarter-square-mile swath of the West Side reaching as far east as 9th Avenue and as far north as 43rd Street.</p><p>The glass-half-full way of looking at this is that the city has been able to create a whole new neighborhood without sinking itself with debt, by leveraging future tax revenues. The less rosy view is that city government has subsidized a forest of office and luxury residential towers by siphoning off for the foreseeable future tax money that under normal circumstances would go into the city's general fund. </p><p>\"I think the way to look upon it is, it's all incremental new income to the city from an area of town that was derelict before and produced no income for the city,\" says Cross. \"So to the extent that we create a lot of construction and we create new space and we grow the working population and we build new residences, the rising tide lifts all boats.\"</p><p>\"This is the 'manna from heaven, we should be grateful' argument,\" counters Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks and analyzes development subsidies nationwide. \"And it really goes to the but-for business.\"</p><p>Ah, the infamous “but-for.” In the development world, it’s a term of art used to justify a multitude of subsidies: If none of this new construction would have happened but for the public money, then giving up future taxes isn’t really a loss, because you <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/244829-if-i-ever-go-looking-for-my-heart-s-desire-again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">never really lost them to begin with</a>. Yet, as critics like LeRoy have pointed out, how can you know for sure if that Iceland-sized GDP wouldn't have appeared regardless? </p><p>The but-for question is an especially vexing one with tax increment financing, or TIF, in which future taxes are kicked back to developers to help pay their costs. (Technically, a TIF requires the creation of a special TIF district, which New York didn't do, hence the rebranding as “value capture”; nonetheless, LeRoy says the Hudson Yards financing \"walks and talks like a TIF to me,\" and Cross openly refers to it as a TIF, so go ahead and consider it one.) And TIFs have a checkered record, with multiple ways things can go awry for taxpayers.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"101118Bloomy.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_chrisrobbins/101118Bloomy.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"><br><i> Mayor Bloomberg joins City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, along with Related Companies's chairman Stephen Ross (far left) to break ground on 26-acre development at Hudson Yards, December 4, 2012 (Photo: Spencer T Tucker)</i></div><p></p><p>First off, the projected development can fail to show up, causing a revenue shortfall and forcing the local government to dip into its general fund to pay off the bonds. That's what happened in Louisville, where a TIF to fund the University of Louisville basketball team's KFC Yum! Center <a href=\"http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2010/09/17/2775/louisville-tif-generating-next-to-no-arena-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">initially brought in almost no new tax revenue</a> in its early years, forcing the city to refinance the project.</p><p>This has already happened, to a lesser extent, at Hudson Yards: Thanks to the Great Recession, a 2013 IBO report noted, the project generated only $170 million in revenues through 2012, not enough to pay off $283 million in debt. (The city eventually refinanced the plan, but only by kicking the can down the road to rely on projected tax payments further in the future.) The good news is that the remaining development to be built at Hudson Yards is largely residential, and the housing market shows little sign of cooling off; the bad news is that <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cities-risk-housing-bubble-144641740.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York is on the short list of cities at risk of succumbing</a> to a real estate bubble, and the residential portion of Hudson Yards doesn't come with the alluring tax breaks that helped jump-start the office towers.</p><p>Secondly, a new neighborhood can develop, but only by siphoning off economic activity from other parts of your city. This is already starting to be seen in Midtown, where Hudson Yards has been successful at attracting new commercial tenants — but in many cases by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/times-square-tenants-that-replaced-porn-make-their-own-retreat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">luring them away from nearby Times Square</a>. </p><p>Cross acknowledges that Hudson Yards office tenants will likely relocate from elsewhere in Manhattan — Coach, the anchor tenant of the first-completed building at 10 Hudson Yards, actually moved from a since-demolished building in Hudson Yards itself — but notes that \"it's a complex dance,\" as ultimately this could open up older office buildings to get retrofitted as needed housing. </p><p>LeRoy remains skeptical, noting that at best this would be an exceedingly inefficient way to create affordable housing. \"Even intellectually honest backers of those programs will admit to you that they don't necessarily create net new economic activity — they simply move it around,\" he says. \"They make it more attractive to do it in one place rather than the other, but they don't create the market for the activity.\"</p><p>Finally, the projected development can show up, but only because it was likely to get built regardless — thus wasting public subsidies on a project that could have been achieved at no cost to taxpayers. Perhaps the most infamous example of this is Chicago, where Mayor Richard M. Daley expanded TIFs at such a precipitous rate that eventually <a href=\"https://cbcny.org/sites/default/files/media/image-caption/figure-01_0.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 40% of city property taxes</a> were being diverted to the districts. One <a href=\"https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/289/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey of recent literature</a> found that between 75% and 98% of projects that got development incentives would have happened even without the public cash, which is a hell of a lot.</p><p>All of these pitfalls, ultimately, come down to but-for: Is your city putting money into a project that will churn out jobs and tax revenues that otherwise wouldn't exist?

For 10 Hudson Yards, the triangular-tipped building to the south that was the first to open in 2016, the estimate is apparently lost somewhere on the city's <a href=\"https://www.nycedc.com/about-nycedc/financial-public-documents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Economic Development Corporation's website</a>, though at more than half the square footage of 50 Hudson Yards, it's likely to be at least $100 million, bringing the total city outlay to roughly $785 million.</p><p>The reason for all these tax breaks, according to Cross, was the city's fear that without reduced property taxes that would allow for lower rents, early adopters would be too fearful of taking a chance on a new neighborhood: \"They said, 'What happens if people don't build office buildings? What can we do to incent them to come?' That's where they got into this sort of early-bird special.\"</p><p>Parrott's response is to ask why developers couldn't just discount rents out of their own pockets, as a loss leader for their future profits on a successful development. \"There is no law of capitalism that says a first mover should be subsidized by government,\" he says.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"101118Hudson15.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_chrisrobbins/101118Hudson15.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"><br><i><a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2015/07/15/hudson_yards_sneak_peek.php\">Hudson Yards in 2015</a> (Jake Dobkin / Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>In the end, there is no smoking gun to this story, no final tally that says exactly how much to the dollar taxpayers have been ripped off by developers in cahoots with city officials. There is only this: In order to support a cluster of crystalline faceted office towers, New York City is delivering about $4.5 billion in tax money; in return, the city is getting a new subway stop (though not one in any of its <a href=\"https://cwhong.carto.com/viz/6dfca01c-47e5-11e6-9fd3-0ee66e2c9693/embed_map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">major transit deserts</a>), a few small parks (most of which so far are limited to some lunchable benches and landscaping), and a new neighborhood of corporate towers and luxury housing.</p><p>Ultimately, it comes down to a fundamental difference of opinion about the nature of growth.

When we create a lot of construction and we create new space and we grow the working population and we build new residences, the rising tide lifts all boats.\" </p><p>Subsidy critics like LeRoy and Parrott counter that not only that one boat's rise can come at the expense of boats across town, but that that rising tide comes with costs — at about <a href=\"http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/school-construction-mayor-adds-1.4-billion-more-thatn-11700-new-seats-to-revised-five-year-capital-plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$80,000 per new school seat</a>, for example, the cost of adding residents can quickly eat up the benefits of collecting their income taxes.</p><p>\"Whether large-scale projects like Hudson Yards or Atlantic Yards pay for themselves is difficult to assess,\" concludes Doug Turetsky, chief of staff for the IBO, which has <a href=\"http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/WestsidefinanceFB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conducted</a> <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/cgi-park/?p=757\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/on-the-far-west-side-citys-hudson-yards-interest-subsidies-reduced-in-near-term-yet-future-subsidies-remain-may-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies</a> of aspects of Hudson Yards financing but has never dared to attempt calculating a total public cost figure. </p><p>\"How much in additional education expenses must the city shoulder because of the hundreds, if not thousands of new families?\" asks Turetsky. \"Do you need additional police and fire coverage? More sanitation pick-ups and disposal? This becomes even harder to assess with a TIF-like project such as Hudson Yards because much of the tax revenue is plowed back into paying for the bonds used to develop the area.

Caemmerer West Side Yard, an open-cut rail yard taking up six city blocks west of Penn Station, officially opened in 1987, on the site of a rail depot that <a href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/26/archives/at-the-hudson-river-railroad-depot-the-obsequies-inside-the-depot.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">dated back to the Civil War</a>. With the Javits Convention Center having debuted one year earlier on the northern part of the yards, this land was soon eyed as well for possible future development:  Rudy Giuliani considered it for the site of <a href=\\\"http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-01/sports/sp-40929_1_yankee-stadium\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">a proposed Yankees stadium</a> \\u2014 a plan killed by the city council in <a href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/29/nyregion/city-council-sues-giuliani-over-charter-commission.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">a rare budget revolt</a> \\u2014 and it was targeted by the Jets owners for a new football and Olympic stadium \\u2014 <a href=\\\"http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2005/06/06/1044/jets-stadium-gets-the-silver-bullet/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">nixed by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver</a> after Madison Square Garden owner James Dolan <a href=\\\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/84249-cablevision-and-msg-spent-30m-to-lobby-against-stadium/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">hired Silver's former chief of staff as a lobbyist</a>. (One legacy of the latter proposal: the Jets\\u2019 stadium czar at the time was Jay Cross, who ended up jumping to Related to head up its own development plans.)</p><p>Before the NFL plan met its demise, it shook loose an important concession from the city council, which approved spending $2 billion to extend the 7 train to 33rd Street and 11th Avenue. New subway lines are usually the responsibility of the MTA, but that authority wanted nothing to do with spending $2 billion to add a single station. Instead, Michael Bloomberg's deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff came up with a plan dubbed \\\"value capture\\\": The city would take tax money collected on the site and siphon it off to pay off the cost of the subway extension and traffic infrastructure, with the goal of making the site more attractive to developers who could create an entire new neighborhood on the failed stadium site.  </p><p>The value that would have to be captured was daunting. To foot the bill, the city redirected a dizzying array of revenue streams to the newly created Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation, a quasi-public agency controlled by, but not technically part of, the city. </p><p>According to figures compiled by the NYC Independent Budget Office, these are (deep breath): $814.4 million from district improvement bonuses, fees paid by developers for exceeding existing zoning limits; $414.9 million from \\\"tax equivalency payments,\\\" residential property taxes funneled to the HYIC; $294.1 million from the resale of those air rights that had purchased from the MTA; and $145.4 million from payments in lieu of property and mortgage recording taxes on commercial properties. The City has also kicked in $281.2 million from its capital budget for items like sewers, $75.5 million for <a href=\\\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/the-shed/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">a performing arts center with retractable walls dubbed The Shed</a>, and $55.4 million in 7 train cost overruns. </p><p>Money spent so far isn't the best way of looking at the split of costs, though. Since the air rights money and zoning bonuses have mostly run their course, the vast majority of the funds will come from future property tax revenues \\u2014 or payments in lieu of waived property taxes \\u2014 from a quarter-square-mile swath of the West Side reaching as far east as 9th Avenue and as far north as 43rd Street.</p><p>The glass-half-full way of looking at this is that the city has been able to create a whole new neighborhood without sinking itself with debt, by leveraging future tax revenues. The less rosy view is that city government has subsidized a forest of office and luxury residential towers by siphoning off for the foreseeable future tax money that under normal circumstances would go into the city's general fund. </p><p>\\\"I think the way to look upon it is, it's all incremental new income to the city from an area of town that was derelict before and produced no income for the city,\\\" says Cross. \\\"So to the extent that we create a lot of construction and we create new space and we grow the working population and we build new residences, the rising tide lifts all boats.\\\"</p><p>\\\"This is the 'manna from heaven, we should be grateful' argument,\\\" counters Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks and analyzes development subsidies nationwide. \\\"And it really goes to the but-for business.\\\"</p><p>Ah, the infamous \\u201cbut-for.\\u201d In the development world, it\\u2019s a term of art used to justify a multitude of subsidies: If none of this new construction would have happened but for the public money, then giving up future taxes isn\\u2019t really a loss, because you <a href=\\\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/244829-if-i-ever-go-looking-for-my-heart-s-desire-again\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">never really lost them to begin with</a>. Yet, as critics like LeRoy have pointed out, how can you know for sure if that Iceland-sized GDP wouldn't have appeared regardless? </p><p>The but-for question is an especially vexing one with tax increment financing, or TIF, in which future taxes are kicked back to developers to help pay their costs. (Technically, a TIF requires the creation of a special TIF district, which New York didn't do, hence the rebranding as \\u201cvalue capture\\u201d; nonetheless, LeRoy says the Hudson Yards financing \\\"walks and talks like a TIF to me,\\\" and Cross openly refers to it as a TIF, so go ahead and consider it one.) And TIFs have a checkered record, with multiple ways things can go awry for taxpayers.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"101118Bloomy.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_chrisrobbins/101118Bloomy.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"427\\\"><br><i> Mayor Bloomberg joins City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, along with Related Companies's chairman Stephen Ross (far left) to break ground on 26-acre development at Hudson Yards, December 4, 2012 (Photo: Spencer T Tucker)</i></div><p></p><p>First off, the projected development can fail to show up, causing a revenue shortfall and forcing the local government to dip into its general fund to pay off the bonds. That's what happened in Louisville, where a TIF to fund the University of Louisville basketball team's KFC Yum! Center <a href=\\\"http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2010/09/17/2775/louisville-tif-generating-next-to-no-arena-money/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">initially brought in almost no new tax revenue</a> in its early years, forcing the city to refinance the project.</p><p>This has already happened, to a lesser extent, at Hudson Yards: Thanks to the Great Recession, a 2013 IBO report noted, the project generated only $170 million in revenues through 2012, not enough to pay off $283 million in debt. (The city eventually refinanced the plan, but only by kicking the can down the road to rely on projected tax payments further in the future.) The good news is that the remaining development to be built at Hudson Yards is largely residential, and the housing market shows little sign of cooling off; the bad news is that <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cities-risk-housing-bubble-144641740.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">New York is on the short list of cities at risk of succumbing</a> to a real estate bubble, and the residential portion of Hudson Yards doesn't come with the alluring tax breaks that helped jump-start the office towers.</p><p>Secondly, a new neighborhood can develop, but only by siphoning off economic activity from other parts of your city. This is already starting to be seen in Midtown, where Hudson Yards has been successful at attracting new commercial tenants \\u2014 but in many cases by <a href=\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/times-square-tenants-that-replaced-porn-make-their-own-retreat\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">luring them away from nearby Times Square</a>. </p><p>Cross acknowledges that Hudson Yards office tenants will likely relocate from elsewhere in Manhattan \\u2014 Coach, the anchor tenant of the first-completed building at 10 Hudson Yards, actually moved from a since-demolished building in Hudson Yards itself \\u2014 but notes that \\\"it's a complex dance,\\\" as ultimately this could open up older office buildings to get retrofitted as needed housing. </p><p>LeRoy remains skeptical, noting that at best this would be an exceedingly inefficient way to create affordable housing. \\\"Even intellectually honest backers of those programs will admit to you that they don't necessarily create net new economic activity \\u2014 they simply move it around,\\\" he says. \\\"They make it more attractive to do it in one place rather than the other, but they don't create the market for the activity.\\\"</p><p>Finally, the projected development can show up, but only because it was likely to get built regardless \\u2014 thus wasting public subsidies on a project that could have been achieved at no cost to taxpayers. Perhaps the most infamous example of this is Chicago, where Mayor Richard M. Daley expanded TIFs at such a precipitous rate that eventually <a href=\\\"https://cbcny.org/sites/default/files/media/image-caption/figure-01_0.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">more than 40% of city property taxes</a> were being diverted to the districts. One <a href=\\\"https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/289/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">survey of recent literature</a> found that between 75% and 98% of projects that got development incentives would have happened even without the public cash, which is a hell of a lot.</p><p>All of these pitfalls, ultimately, come down to but-for: Is your city putting money into a project that will churn out jobs and tax revenues that otherwise wouldn't exist? Or is it throwing money at something that developers would want to do regardless, but are happy enough to take a few billion in cash for to boost their profits?</p><p>LeRoy calls but-for \\\"a political deflector shield,\\\" providing cover for elected officials who might otherwise come under fire for handing over tax money to wealthy real estate barons. </p><p>\\\"What happens is, taxpayers get upset at politicians for granting an overly generous TIF package,\\\" he says. \\\"The politicians say, 'But the developers signed the but-for clause, that this wouldn't have happened but for the TIFs.' And because nobody ever gets to see inside the developers' books, we just have to take their word for it.

For 30 Hudson Yards \\u2014 the angular North Tower and accompanying mall that is nearing completion \\u2014 it comes to <a href=\\\"http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/ERYIDAApplicationNorthTowerandMall.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">$328 million</a>; for 50 Hudson Yards, currently just an open pit north across 33rd Street, <a href=\\\"https://www.nycedc.com/sites/default/files/filemanager/NYCIDA/Public_Hearing_Packages/2017_Public_Hearing_Packages/50_HYMC_Public_Hearing_Package.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">$177 million</a>; for3 Hudson Boulevard, an unremarkable glass box under construction across from the Javits Center, <a href=\\\"https://commercialobserver.com/2015/02/moinian-brookfield-get-hudson-yards-tax-abatements-totaling-180m/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">$65 million</a>; for Manhattan West, the subtly rounded shaft a block east of the rail yards that is the most visible indicator of Hudson Yards for much of the city, <a href=\\\"https://commercialobserver.com/2015/02/moinian-brookfield-get-hudson-yards-tax-abatements-totaling-180m/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">$115 million</a>. For 10 Hudson Yards, the triangular-tipped building to the south that was the first to open in 2016, the estimate is apparently lost somewhere on the city's <a href=\\\"https://www.nycedc.com/about-nycedc/financial-public-documents\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Economic Development Corporation's website</a>, though at more than half the square footage of 50 Hudson Yards, it's likely to be at least $100 million, bringing the total city outlay to roughly $785 million.</p><p>The reason for all these tax breaks, according to Cross, was the city's fear that without reduced property taxes that would allow for lower rents, early adopters would be too fearful of taking a chance on a new neighborhood: \\\"They said, 'What happens if people don't build office buildings? What can we do to incent them to come?' That's where they got into this sort of early-bird special.\\\"</p><p>Parrott's response is to ask why developers couldn't just discount rents out of their own pockets, as a loss leader for their future profits on a successful development. \\\"There is no law of capitalism that says a first mover should be subsidized by government,\\\" he says.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"101118Hudson15.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_chrisrobbins/101118Hudson15.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"427\\\"><br><i><a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2015/07/15/hudson_yards_sneak_peek.php\\\">Hudson Yards in 2015</a> (Jake Dobkin / Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>In the end, there is no smoking gun to this story, no final tally that says exactly how much to the dollar taxpayers have been ripped off by developers in cahoots with city officials. There is only this: In order to support a cluster of crystalline faceted office towers, New York City is delivering about $4.5 billion in tax money; in return, the city is getting a new subway stop (though not one in any of its <a href=\\\"https://cwhong.carto.com/viz/6dfca01c-47e5-11e6-9fd3-0ee66e2c9693/embed_map\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">major transit deserts</a>), a few small parks (most of which so far are limited to some lunchable benches and landscaping), and a new neighborhood of corporate towers and luxury housing.</p><p>Ultimately, it comes down to a fundamental difference of opinion about the nature of growth. Developers like Cross insist it's an inherent good: \\\"Economic growth in general is always good for a city \\u2014 it leads to greater taxes. When we create a lot of construction and we create new space and we grow the working population and we build new residences, the rising tide lifts all boats.\\\" </p><p>Subsidy critics like LeRoy and Parrott counter that not only that one boat's rise can come at the expense of boats across town, but that that rising tide comes with costs \\u2014 at about <a href=\\\"http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/school-construction-mayor-adds-1.4-billion-more-thatn-11700-new-seats-to-revised-five-year-capital-plan.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">$80,000 per new school seat</a>, for example, the cost of adding residents can quickly eat up the benefits of collecting their income taxes.</p><p>\\\"Whether large-scale projects like Hudson Yards or Atlantic Yards pay for themselves is difficult to assess,\\\" concludes Doug Turetsky, chief of staff for the IBO, which has <a href=\\\"http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/WestsidefinanceFB.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">conducted</a> <a href=\\\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/cgi-park/?p=757\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">several</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/on-the-far-west-side-citys-hudson-yards-interest-subsidies-reduced-in-near-term-yet-future-subsidies-remain-may-2016.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">studies</a> of aspects of Hudson Yards financing but has never dared to attempt calculating a total public cost figure. </p><p>\\\"How much in additional education expenses must the city shoulder because of the hundreds, if not thousands of new families?\\\" asks Turetsky. \\\"Do you need additional police and fire coverage? More sanitation pick-ups and disposal? This becomes even harder to assess with a TIF-like project such as Hudson Yards because much of the tax revenue is plowed back into paying for the bonds used to develop the area. So what is it generating for the city as a whole?\\\"</p><p>Welcome to the future, where $4.5 billion in tax money can be spent without anyone knowing for sure if it will be a boon or a money pit. Ultimately, how well you can stomach Hudson Yards will depend on how willing you are to roll the dice based on developers' math. And how much you like big metal bugs.</p>\", \"text_more\": null, \"thumbnail_105\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2018/10/101118HudsonYards-thumb-105x105-1024876.jpg\", \"thumbnail_300\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2018/10/101118HudsonYards-thumb-300x300-1024876.jpg\", \"thumbnail_60\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2018/10/101118HudsonYards-thumb-60x60-1024876.jpg\", \"thumbnail_640\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2018/10/101118HudsonYards-thumb-640xauto-1024876.jpg\", \"title\": \"Hudson Yards Has $4.5 Billion In Taxpayer Money.

As the program grew to include over 300 buildings and over 3,000 apartments, the city increased the rates it paid landlords and nonprofits, even as the buildings deteriorated and social services were slow in coming. </p><p>By 2015, when the Department of Investigation released a report calling clusters the worst-maintained, least-monitored type of shelters, the city was paying landlords and nonprofits $2,451 a month on average per unit. Because cluster site shelters are overwhelmingly in poor and working-class neighborhoods, that figure was more than double the average rent the apartments would have fetched on the market. </p><p>As the program has grown, paying tenants have complained with increasing frequency of their landlords pushing them out to make shelter money.</p><p>Early last year, Mayor de Blasio <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/homeless_cluster_site.php\">announced</a> he was going to phase out the cluster site scheme by 2018. He has since extended the deadline to 2021, but in May the mayor touted the removal of more than 800 apartments from the program, saying, \"Our homeless families deserve better and we will continue to take aggressive action in closing down the remaining sites and replacing them with better, safer shelters to help them get back on their feet and into permanent housing.\"</p><p>There's a wrinkle, though. Data obtained by Gothamist shows that of 3,300 cluster apartments in use at one point in fiscal year 2016, 3,167 were in rent-stabilized buildings. A combination of lax state oversight and landlord-friendly carveouts in the rent laws could make such apartments ripe for deregulation as the city pulls out. And responses to public records requests by the relevant city and state agencies suggest that despite <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/05/16/depends_on_what_affordable_means.php\">the mayor's plan</a> to create and preserve 200,000 below-market apartments by 2024, little has been done so far to prevent this.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://editorial-ny.dnainfo.com/interactives/gothamist/2017/cluster-units/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800\"></iframe><br><em>Sources: Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Department of Finance, Human Resources Administration, John Krauss, Picture the Homeless, RentLogic (Tanveer Ali/Gothamist)</em></p><p>It's too late for Shanae Yates and her onetime neighbors on Vyse Avenue. A Virginia native, Yates has lived in the Bronx since she was a young girl, and has spent most of the past 20 years on the same block near East 174th Street. When she first looked at apartments in the big brick building in 2000, it was fully rent-stabilized, and she was pregnant with her second daughter. The landlord at the time was Wolf Posalski—everybody knew him as Willie—and tenants remember him as exceedingly accommodating. For Yates, he arranged to speed up renovations on a first-floor one-bedroom, so she wouldn't have to climb stairs. </p><p>The building \"was always clean,\" Yates said. \"All of the issues were addressed immediately. They didn’t prolong things.\" She recalled that once, when her refrigerator stopped working, she called Posalski at home and, \"He said, 'Don’t worry. Go buy some new bags of ice and we’ll have a new fridge in the morning.'\"</p><p>Her starting rent was $585, and \"when it came time to renew your lease, [Willie] would always work with you.\" Sometimes, Posalski didn't raise the rent at all. \"He'd say, 'I'd rather have people I know living here,'\" Yates recalled.</p><p>Posalski died in 2007, and his daughter Rochelle took over, making his monthly Sunday rounds, collecting rent personally from each tenant. Within a few years, Posalski's business partners gained control, and according to public records and seven former tenants, that's when everything started to change.</p><p>The repairs got sloppier, managers began offering buyouts, and bills and legal threats started appearing in the mail, demanding late rent. This occurred even, tenants said, when they had paid on time. Around this time, in the early 2010s, then live-in handyman David Forbes recalls that David Green of the new owner RRW Realty told him, \"I could make this a homeless shelter and get $97,000 a month.\" </p><p>Green is one of 13 cluster site owners on Public Advocate Letitia James's 100 Worst Landlords list for 2016. Together, the 13 men owned 76 of 300 buildings in the program at one point in fiscal year 2016. City records obtained by Gothamist indicate that a cluster shelter building on Intervale Avenue that is 15 units smaller brings in about $83,000 in rental income a month.</p><p>As longtime tenants moved out, shelter residents moved in, and the building deteriorated. There were mice and roach infestations. The building lacked security, according to Yates, and some of the shelter people came with their own problems. Tenants recalled stepping out to find people sleeping on the roof and under the stairs, people drinking, and smoking cigarettes, marijuana, and crack in the hallways. </p><p>\"You’ve got to watch your kids a lot closer,\" former tenant Alicia Galasso said of that time. Prior to that, she trusted her neighbors so much she didn't lock her door. That changed. \"You don’t know people now,\" she remembered. \"You don’t trust people.\" </p><p>Tenants say building managers warned them that they couldn't guarantee their safety if they stayed. In February 2013, the building's renters received a letter that read, \"Please be aware that the landlord is not renewing any leases in the building, at the present time. If you would like to terminate your lease, you will not be penalized.\" It was signed, \"The Management.\" Outside of a handful of heavily regulated processes and taking over apartments for one's family, landlords are legally barred from withholding renewal leases from rent-stabilized tenants.</p><p>Nevertheless, the tenants on Vyse got the message.</p><p>\"Towards the end people had started just leaving quickly,\" Galasso recalled. \"They were evicting people, saying people owed rent that they didn’t owe, late fees built up on what they were claiming.\"</p><p>Faced with the constant pressure and growing chaos, as well as a family illness, Galasso moved out of state, no buyout necessary.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"170628ShanaeYates.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170628ShanaeYates.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"><br><i> Shanae Yates visits her old building, which is now being used entirely as a homeless shelter. (Clay Williams/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>Yates was one of a handful of tenants who stuck it out to the end. In early 2013, squatters had taken up residence in some of the empty apartments, and begun their own war with the landlords, some former tenants said. The building lost heat and hot water. The squatters stole new appliances from fixed-up apartments, and according to Yates, threw old radiators off the roof. </p><p>Then someone brought two pit bulls to the building and left them in an empty apartment. Soon, the dogs were barking day and night.</p><p>\"They knew that dogs could only handle their own piss and feces for so long,\" said Jayquan Brown. \"The stink of it. They were trying to get us out.\"</p><p>\"That was the idea,\" said Forbes, part of a huddle of former tenants reminiscing outside another RRW building down the block. </p><p>The dogs remained for months, occasionally getting loose in the halls, prompting parents to rush their children inside, according to tenants. People called 311 about the dogs from February to May, records show. When the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals came in July, the dogs were gone, according to a spokeswoman for the organization.</p><p>Brown said he moved to another RRW building, in Fordham Heights. He had been paying $685 on Vyse. At the new place, a one-bedroom, his rent was $1,000. After a year, he says the landlord asked for $1,400. He moved out.</p><p>\"Best thing I ever did,\" he said.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"170629MiriamSmith.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170629MiriamSmith.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"><br><i> Miriam Smith has been taken to court repeatedly over rent nonpayment claims that she says are spurious since she moved out of the shelter building on Vyse Avenue and into another RRW building down the block. (Clay Williams/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>Yates, who once worked as a real estate broker and is now in billing at a Bronx hospital, negotiated better terms in her move to a building down the block on Vyse. Draft leases she declined to sign include a page agreeing to preferential rent terms, a rent-stabilization workaround wherein landlords reserve the right to charge a higher rate, above and beyond the annual increase prescribed by the city Rent Guidelines Board. The field on the draft leases where the preferential rent amount was supposed to be specified were blank, to be returned signed by the renter sight unseen.</p><p>Yates says she kept her original rent rate and avoided agreeing to a preferential rent, whereas some of her neighbors who made the same move are now having their rents spiked dramatically thanks to this provision.</p><p>Calls and emails to RRW and various partners and property managers were not returned. David Green also did not respond to a message left with a worker at a bakery on Avenue J in Midwood that he has listed as his address on eviction papers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old building has been turned over entirely to cluster use. There's a security station in the lobby now, and though the place had 47 open Housing Preservation and Development violations in May, it's in fairly good shape for a cluster site.</p><p>\"I'm not going to say it's the worst place in the world,\" said one shelter resident who declined to give his name. </p><p>The shelter is being run by Housing Bridge, a nonprofit that has $84.9 million in active city contracts despite <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-controller-shoots-homeless-shelter-due-corruption-article-1.2638026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> state and city investigations into its leaders over millions in undisclosed loans to founder Isaac Leshinsky. Lehsinsky was forced out in 2015 in connection with the scandal. The city will hand the building off to a group called the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/nyregion/for-transgender-new-yorkers-a-center-of-their-own-in-the-bronx.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bronx Parent Housing Network</a> next week, according to a Department of Homeless Services spokesman. </p><p>What happens, in 2021, when DHS has pulled out of the building?

(Tenant Protection Unit/Kings County Supreme Court)</i></div><p></p><p>Last summer in Brooklyn, the city stopped using seven buildings owned by landlord <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/barryhers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Barry Hers</a> and two others used by the nonprofit We Always Care. The Legal Aid Society is representing tenants and shelter residents who stayed behind at both sets of buildings, as well as at <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/60clarkson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">60 Clarkson Avenue</a> in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, vacated in 2015. Lawyers argue that the shelter residents should be entitled to stay on with rent-stabilized leases, their rent covered in part by vouchers. </p><p>Legal Aid has also obtained rent rolls that attorneys say show Hers raised rents on apartments in the shelter program year after year with no grounding in rent board increases or apartment improvements. They argue that rent rates should have been paused at the rent the last tenant was paying. Longtime tenants, too, were allegedly overcharged.</p><p>Two-bedrooms in 60 Clarkson, cleared of most longtime tenants and all but 22 shelter families, are now <a href=\"http://streeteasy.com/building/60-clarkson-avenue-brooklyn#tab_building_detail=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renting for $2,400</a>.</p><p>The state's <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/tenantprotectionunit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tenant Protection Unit</a> fought Hers and his family members in court last year over subpoenas as part of <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/barry_hers_dhcr_investigation.php\">a probe into possible harassment</a> and rent roll fraud. The status of that investigation is unclear.</p><p>One doesn't have to be a criminal to profit off of the end of the cluster program, though. Since the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-vote-that-made-new-york-city-rents-so-high\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mid-'90s</a>, state legislators have added a series of escape hatches to the rent stabilization law, allowing landlords to tie permanent rent increases to claimed building improvements, adding increases each time there's a vacancy, and deregulating apartments once they rise above a certain rent cap. </p><p>The city has <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2015/07/15/rent_stabilized_map_nyc.php\">lost more than 50,000 rent-stabilized apartments</a> in the last decade. Meanwhile, wages in New York City have stayed basically flat, and housing costs and <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/homelessness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homelessness</a> have skyrocketed. The burden of challenging an apartment's rent rate is on the tenant, who must suspect her place is supposed to be rent-stabilized, request a rent history, and if it looks fishy, file a formal challenge. Only then do building owners have to produce receipts to back up claimed construction. And even then, the city is not starved for contractors willing to <a href=\"http://www.issuelab.org/resource/the_20_000_stove_how_fraudulent_rent_increases_undermine_new_york_s_affordable_housing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">write a receipt</a> saying, for instance, that a door cost $5,000 (Disclosure: My landlord found such a contractor). </p><p>\"That is a problem with any apartment when it’s vacated,\" said Ed Josephson, director of litigation and housing at Legal Services NYC, and a lawyer working on one of the We Always Care cases. \"There are so many problems with the rent laws in terms of loopholes that the legislature refuses to close that the landlord can renovate, or pretend to renovate, and bring the rent over the decontrol threshold.\" </p><p>Low-income housing defenders noted that the Tenant Protection Unit, which has a reported <a href=\"http://www.gothamgazette.com/government/5764-cuomo-tenant-protection-unit-an-overlooked-part-of-rent-regulation-debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">staff of 25</a> compared to the 744 of its parent agency, the <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/dhcr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Division of Housing and Community Renewal</a>, is the one truly proactive piece of the state's enforcement system. </p><p>\"The numbers alone and DHCR’s limited resources makes it entirely possible that somebody could try to get away with\" using the end of the cluster program to evade rent rules, said Rajiv Jaswa, a staff attorney at the Urban Justice Center's Community Development Project. \"All of a sudden having to track actually how many improvements have been made in that many units is very difficult.\"</p><p>Anemic responses to a series of public records requests of city agencies and DHCR suggest that no formal program is in place for tracking cluster apartments' regulation status. A DHS spokesman said that the agency is feeding DHCR addresses where it has stopped using apartments for the cluster program and referred further questions on the issue to DHCR.</p><p>The state agency's spokeswoman Charni Sochet wrote in an email, \"HCR is working with our city partners in the New York City Human Resources Administration to implement a plan to notify landlords about the requirement to re-register apartments exiting the city’s program so that they can be rightfully returned to the rent stabilization rolls, where appropriate.\" She did not respond to further questions.</p><p>Even the issue of how and whether to register rent-stabilized apartments in the cluster program with the state has not been formally settled in the program's 17-year history, according to advocates and the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord lobbying group. The RSA, incidentally, recently <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/13/reuters-america-cuomo-initiative-to-protect-new-york-tenants-wins-court-backing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lost a lawsuit</a> seeking to disband the Tenant Protection Unit. All 64 apartments in the Vyse Avenue building were designated rent-stabilized in 2007, according to Department of Finance data <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2015/07/15/rent_stabilized_map_nyc.php\">scraped by civic-minded data nerds</a>.

A 2016 city document seeking proposals for the Housing Bridge portfolio gives bidders the option of turning a property into permanent housing for renters with vouchers, turning it into permanent housing with a nonprofit holding a master lease and providing services, or turning a property \"to a standalone shelter.\" </p><p>Similarly, a 2016 contract with the provider Acacia Network Housing says the group should \"discuss and actively pursue\" permanent housing at three buildings, but also seems to say that it should keep operating in other buildings and convert the contracts \"From Cluster Contracts Into Shelter Contracts.\" An even more eye-opening option in the document seems to suggest that Acacia should vacate even more apartments, saying that where the group \"plans to secure additional Units in the Building\" it should \"[exchange] Units in some Buildings for Units in other Buildings in its portfolio.\"</p><p>Apparently referencing these documents, the mayor's 2017 Turning the Tide homelessness plan says, \"Some new providers will upgrade and convert a portion of these units to permanent housing; other locations will be renovated and operated as high-quality shelters that are clean and safe and have social services on site.\"</p><p>A DHS representative objected to the notion that the second option is a call to further empty out occupied buildings, but did acknowledge that the agency's citywide plan includes keeping some buildings as shelters under a different categorization.</p><p>DHS spokesman Isaac McGinn said in a statement: </p><blockquote><p>As we work to turn the tide on homelessness, including ending the 17-year-old practice of using cluster units, we have committed to using every tool at our disposal to help homeless New Yorkers transition to permanent housing and preserve affordability in the process. That’s why we’re coordinating with DHCR to ensure landlords comply with our rent regulation laws as cluster apartments are returned to market and rent stabilization. That’s why we’re working with City agency partners to apply strategies aimed at strengthening and deepening affordability at viable sites. And that’s why, where appropriate, we’re evaluating units for conversion to permanent housing  and sites for conversion to more effective shelter, as outlined in <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dhs/downloads/pdf/turning-the-tide-on-homelessness.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our plan</a>. \n</p></blockquote><p>Mayor's Office spokeswoman Melissa Grace wrote in her own statement,&nbsp;\"As we work to end the use of cluster apartments, [the Department of Social Services] is in close contact with the State to ensure these homes are properly registered as rent regulated and tenants have the protections they are due by law. At the same time, City agencies are working hand-in-glove to identify buildings where HPD’s financing tools can be used to preserve and strengthen long-term affordability.\"</p><p>She noted that rent-stabilized apartments are not counted towards the mayor's goal of building or preserving 200,000 affordable apartments. Rather, the total reflects buildings where the owners have entered regulatory agreements with the city to ensure certain price levels over set periods of time.</p><p>Public Advocate Letitia James said that she has been talking to HRA and DHS head Steven Banks about the issue, and is planning a meeting with TPU Deputy Commissioner Richard White to go over it further. Asked if she sees how vacating apartments to create new shelter units is counterproductive, James said, \"Yes.\" She paused, then added, \"I could see your argument. I think it’s part of an overall plan as we build more affordable housing, which takes time. In the meantime we’re going to have to house these families, build as fast as we possibly can, and work with the state to address this issue.\"</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"170628GiulianiHomeless.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170628GiulianiHomeless.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"><br><i> Rudy Giuliani, on TV, was a frequent target of advocates for homeless rights, including Steve Banks. (Roger Lemoyne/Getty)</i></div><p></p><p>Martin Oesterreich, the architect of the cluster site model, never expected things to get to this point. Now retired, Oesterreich served as former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's homeless services commissioner towards the end of Giuliani's tenure. Faced with a growing homeless population, a mayor more interested in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/nyregion/judge-upholds-policy-on-arresting-the-homeless-who-sleep-in-boxes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">locking up homeless people</a> than helping them, and a never-ending series of lawsuits from the <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/legalaidsociety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Legal Aid Society</a> seeking to cement the right to shelter in New York City and improve conditions, Oesterreich had his work cut out for him. </p><p>\"It was never intended to be a permanent program,\" said Oesterreich of the cluster site program. \"What ended up happening was that there were occasional spikes—if you don’t have online capacity to absorb those spikes you need to do a couple of different things.\"</p><p>One option was putting homeless people in hotels. This, he said, is \"not a good option,\" because hotels lack facilities such as kitchenettes that are required in shelters. The problem of where to physically put people was so pronounced that, at one point, Giuliani administration officials considered placing families in a former Bronx jail. Bloomberg actually <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/14/nyregion/inner-circle-of-bloomberg-aides-put-homeless-shelter-in-old-jail.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">did</a>. Clusters, as we've seen, present their own issues.</p><p>\"The theory was originally to try to locate apartments as close together as possible, to cluster them in a particular neighborhood,\" Oesterreich said. \"From a management perspective, it represents a bunch of challenges. If you control an entire building you can ensure security, you can ensure on-site activities, you can ensure all sorts of services are provided. In a cluster site situation it becomes much more difficult.\"</p><p>Asked if he'd ever considered the potential for the program to incentivize tenant harassment and deregulate apartments when setting up the program, Oesterreich said, \"No. It was never an issue.\" He said he doubted that landlords would willingly trade reliable tenants for shelter residents and the baggage some of them carry. Then I told him how much the city is paying. </p><p>\"Wow...I don’t know how to respond to that,\" he said. \"I can understand now why low-income housing advocates would look at this and say, 'You’re distorting the market for regular people.' I could understand how they could get there. Astonishing.\"</p><p>Perhaps also astonishing is the rise of one of Oesterreich's chief antagonists, Legal Aid's Steven Banks, who worked on the litigation that established the right to shelter, to the job of de Blasio's homeless services commissioner. In that role, Banks faces many familiar criticisms, including slowness to address appalling shelter conditions, failure to reduce the shelter population, now at a record 60,000, and as the cluster program winds down without immediate capacity to replace lost units, over-reliance on hotels.</p><p>\"Schadenfreude is a phrase that could be used,\" Oesterreich said, adding that he wishes Banks the best. </p><p>Publicly, the current mayoral administration points to <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2011/09/14/city_doesnt_have_to_subsidize_rent.php\">voucher cuts by Governor Cuomo and Michael Bloomberg</a> and a lack of emphasis on affordable housing construction by Bloomberg and Giuliani as drivers of the homelessness crisis. Privately, some homeless services officials and providers say that they don't like relying on negligent landlords, but that until there are more shelters and more housing in reach of poor people, they have little choice. </p><p>Oesterreich agrees. He explained, \"If you continue looking for additional capacity, after a while the landlord figures out that there’s no way they’re going to close it down. They’ve got you by the short hairs.\"</p>"

As the program grew to include over 300 buildings and over 3,000 apartments, the city increased the rates it paid landlords and nonprofits, even as the buildings deteriorated and social services were slow in coming. </p><p>By 2015, when the Department of Investigation released a report calling clusters the worst-maintained, least-monitored type of shelters, the city was paying landlords and nonprofits $2,451 a month on average per unit. Because cluster site shelters are overwhelmingly in poor and working-class neighborhoods, that figure was more than double the average rent the apartments would have fetched on the market. </p><p>As the program has grown, paying tenants have complained with increasing frequency of their landlords pushing them out to make shelter money.</p><p>Early last year, Mayor de Blasio <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/homeless_cluster_site.php\\\">announced</a> he was going to phase out the cluster site scheme by 2018. He has since extended the deadline to 2021, but in May the mayor touted the removal of more than 800 apartments from the program, saying, \\\"Our homeless families deserve better and we will continue to take aggressive action in closing down the remaining sites and replacing them with better, safer shelters to help them get back on their feet and into permanent housing.\\\"</p><p>There's a wrinkle, though. Data obtained by Gothamist shows that of 3,300 cluster apartments in use at one point in fiscal year 2016, 3,167 were in rent-stabilized buildings. A combination of lax state oversight and landlord-friendly carveouts in the rent laws could make such apartments ripe for deregulation as the city pulls out. And responses to public records requests by the relevant city and state agencies suggest that despite <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/05/16/depends_on_what_affordable_means.php\\\">the mayor's plan</a> to create and preserve 200,000 below-market apartments by 2024, little has been done so far to prevent this.</p><p><iframe src=\\\"https://editorial-ny.dnainfo.com/interactives/gothamist/2017/cluster-units/\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"800\\\"></iframe><br><em>Sources: Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Department of Finance, Human Resources Administration, John Krauss, Picture the Homeless, RentLogic (Tanveer Ali/Gothamist)</em></p><p>It's too late for Shanae Yates and her onetime neighbors on Vyse Avenue. A Virginia native, Yates has lived in the Bronx since she was a young girl, and has spent most of the past 20 years on the same block near East 174th Street. When she first looked at apartments in the big brick building in 2000, it was fully rent-stabilized, and she was pregnant with her second daughter. The landlord at the time was Wolf Posalski\\u2014everybody knew him as Willie\\u2014and tenants remember him as exceedingly accommodating. For Yates, he arranged to speed up renovations on a first-floor one-bedroom, so she wouldn't have to climb stairs. </p><p>The building \\\"was always clean,\\\" Yates said. \\\"All of the issues were addressed immediately. They didn\\u2019t prolong things.\\\" She recalled that once, when her refrigerator stopped working, she called Posalski at home and, \\\"He said, 'Don\\u2019t worry. Go buy some new bags of ice and we\\u2019ll have a new fridge in the morning.'\\\"</p><p>Her starting rent was $585, and \\\"when it came time to renew your lease, [Willie] would always work with you.\\\" Sometimes, Posalski didn't raise the rent at all. \\\"He'd say, 'I'd rather have people I know living here,'\\\" Yates recalled.</p><p>Posalski died in 2007, and his daughter Rochelle took over, making his monthly Sunday rounds, collecting rent personally from each tenant. Within a few years, Posalski's business partners gained control, and according to public records and seven former tenants, that's when everything started to change.</p><p>The repairs got sloppier, managers began offering buyouts, and bills and legal threats started appearing in the mail, demanding late rent. This occurred even, tenants said, when they had paid on time. Around this time, in the early 2010s, then live-in handyman David Forbes recalls that David Green of the new owner RRW Realty told him, \\\"I could make this a homeless shelter and get $97,000 a month.\\\" </p><p>Green is one of 13 cluster site owners on Public Advocate Letitia James's 100 Worst Landlords list for 2016. Together, the 13 men owned 76 of 300 buildings in the program at one point in fiscal year 2016. City records obtained by Gothamist indicate that a cluster shelter building on Intervale Avenue that is 15 units smaller brings in about $83,000 in rental income a month.</p><p>As longtime tenants moved out, shelter residents moved in, and the building deteriorated. There were mice and roach infestations. The building lacked security, according to Yates, and some of the shelter people came with their own problems. Tenants recalled stepping out to find people sleeping on the roof and under the stairs, people drinking, and smoking cigarettes, marijuana, and crack in the hallways. </p><p>\\\"You\\u2019ve got to watch your kids a lot closer,\\\" former tenant Alicia Galasso said of that time. Prior to that, she trusted her neighbors so much she didn't lock her door. That changed. \\\"You don\\u2019t know people now,\\\" she remembered. \\\"You don\\u2019t trust people.\\\" </p><p>Tenants say building managers warned them that they couldn't guarantee their safety if they stayed. In February 2013, the building's renters received a letter that read, \\\"Please be aware that the landlord is not renewing any leases in the building, at the present time. If you would like to terminate your lease, you will not be penalized.\\\" It was signed, \\\"The Management.\\\" Outside of a handful of heavily regulated processes and taking over apartments for one's family, landlords are legally barred from withholding renewal leases from rent-stabilized tenants.</p><p>Nevertheless, the tenants on Vyse got the message.</p><p>\\\"Towards the end people had started just leaving quickly,\\\" Galasso recalled. \\\"They were evicting people, saying people owed rent that they didn\\u2019t owe, late fees built up on what they were claiming.\\\"</p><p>Faced with the constant pressure and growing chaos, as well as a family illness, Galasso moved out of state, no buyout necessary.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"170628ShanaeYates.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170628ShanaeYates.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"427\\\"><br><i> Shanae Yates visits her old building, which is now being used entirely as a homeless shelter.

In early 2013, squatters had taken up residence in some of the empty apartments, and begun their own war with the landlords, some former tenants said. The building lost heat and hot water. The squatters stole new appliances from fixed-up apartments, and according to Yates, threw old radiators off the roof. </p><p>Then someone brought two pit bulls to the building and left them in an empty apartment. Soon, the dogs were barking day and night.</p><p>\\\"They knew that dogs could only handle their own piss and feces for so long,\\\" said Jayquan Brown. \\\"The stink of it. They were trying to get us out.\\\"</p><p>\\\"That was the idea,\\\" said Forbes, part of a huddle of former tenants reminiscing outside another RRW building down the block. </p><p>The dogs remained for months, occasionally getting loose in the halls, prompting parents to rush their children inside, according to tenants. People called 311 about the dogs from February to May, records show. When the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals came in July, the dogs were gone, according to a spokeswoman for the organization.</p><p>Brown said he moved to another RRW building, in Fordham Heights. He had been paying $685 on Vyse. At the new place, a one-bedroom, his rent was $1,000. After a year, he says the landlord asked for $1,400.

David Green also did not respond to a message left with a worker at a bakery on Avenue J in Midwood that he has listed as his address on eviction papers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old building has been turned over entirely to cluster use. There's a security station in the lobby now, and though the place had 47 open Housing Preservation and Development violations in May, it's in fairly good shape for a cluster site.</p><p>\\\"I'm not going to say it's the worst place in the world,\\\" said one shelter resident who declined to give his name. </p><p>The shelter is being run by Housing Bridge, a nonprofit that has $84.9 million in active city contracts despite <a href=\\\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-controller-shoots-homeless-shelter-due-corruption-article-1.2638026\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">reported</a> state and city investigations into its leaders over millions in undisclosed loans to founder Isaac Leshinsky.

And even then, the city is not starved for contractors willing to <a href=\\\"http://www.issuelab.org/resource/the_20_000_stove_how_fraudulent_rent_increases_undermine_new_york_s_affordable_housing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">write a receipt</a> saying, for instance, that a door cost $5,000 (Disclosure: My landlord found such a contractor). </p><p>\\\"That is a problem with any apartment when it\\u2019s vacated,\\\" said Ed Josephson, director of litigation and housing at Legal Services NYC, and a lawyer working on one of the We Always Care cases. \\\"There are so many problems with the rent laws in terms of loopholes that the legislature refuses to close that the landlord can renovate, or pretend to renovate, and bring the rent over the decontrol threshold.\\\" </p><p>Low-income housing defenders noted that the Tenant Protection Unit, which has a reported <a href=\\\"http://www.gothamgazette.com/government/5764-cuomo-tenant-protection-unit-an-overlooked-part-of-rent-regulation-debate\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">staff of 25</a> compared to the 744 of its parent agency, the <a href=\\\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/dhcr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Division of Housing and Community Renewal</a>, is the one truly proactive piece of the state's enforcement system. </p><p>\\\"The numbers alone and DHCR\\u2019s limited resources makes it entirely possible that somebody could try to get away with\\\" using the end of the cluster program to evade rent rules, said Rajiv Jaswa, a staff attorney at the Urban Justice Center's Community Development Project. \\\"All of a sudden having to track actually how many improvements have been made in that many units is very difficult.\\\"</p><p>Anemic responses to a series of public records requests of city agencies and DHCR suggest that no formal program is in place for tracking cluster apartments' regulation status. A DHS spokesman said that the agency is feeding DHCR addresses where it has stopped using apartments for the cluster program and referred further questions on the issue to DHCR.</p><p>The state agency's spokeswoman Charni Sochet wrote in an email, \\\"HCR is working with our city partners in the New York City Human Resources Administration to implement a plan to notify landlords about the requirement to re-register apartments exiting the city\\u2019s program so that they can be rightfully returned to the rent stabilization rolls, where appropriate.\\\" She did not respond to further questions.</p><p>Even the issue of how and whether to register rent-stabilized apartments in the cluster program with the state has not been formally settled in the program's 17-year history, according to advocates and the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord lobbying group. The RSA, incidentally, recently <a href=\\\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/13/reuters-america-cuomo-initiative-to-protect-new-york-tenants-wins-court-backing.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">lost a lawsuit</a> seeking to disband the Tenant Protection Unit. All 64 apartments in the Vyse Avenue building were designated rent-stabilized in 2007, according to Department of Finance data <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2015/07/15/rent_stabilized_map_nyc.php\\\">scraped by civic-minded data nerds</a>.

A 2016 city document seeking proposals for the Housing Bridge portfolio gives bidders the option of turning a property into permanent housing for renters with vouchers, turning it into permanent housing with a nonprofit holding a master lease and providing services, or turning a property \\\"to a standalone shelter.\\\" </p><p>Similarly, a 2016 contract with the provider Acacia Network Housing says the group should \\\"discuss and actively pursue\\\" permanent housing at three buildings, but also seems to say that it should keep operating in other buildings and convert the contracts \\\"From Cluster Contracts Into Shelter Contracts.\\\" An even more eye-opening option in the document seems to suggest that Acacia should vacate even more apartments, saying that where the group \\\"plans to secure additional Units in the Building\\\" it should \\\"[exchange] Units in some Buildings for Units in other Buildings in its portfolio.\\\"</p><p>Apparently referencing these documents, the mayor's 2017 Turning the Tide homelessness plan says, \\\"Some new providers will upgrade and convert a portion of these units to permanent housing; other locations will be renovated and operated as high-quality shelters that are clean and safe and have social services on site.\\\"</p><p>A DHS representative objected to the notion that the second option is a call to further empty out occupied buildings, but did acknowledge that the agency's citywide plan includes keeping some buildings as shelters under a different categorization.</p><p>DHS spokesman Isaac McGinn said in a statement: </p><blockquote><p>As we work to turn the tide on homelessness, including ending the 17-year-old practice of using cluster units, we have committed to using every tool at our disposal to help homeless New Yorkers transition to permanent housing and preserve affordability in the process. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re coordinating with DHCR to ensure landlords comply with our rent regulation laws as cluster apartments are returned to market and rent stabilization. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re working with City agency partners to apply strategies aimed at strengthening and deepening affordability at viable sites. And that\\u2019s why, where appropriate, we\\u2019re evaluating units for conversion to permanent housing  and sites for conversion to more effective shelter, as outlined in <a href=\\\"http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dhs/downloads/pdf/turning-the-tide-on-homelessness.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">our plan</a>. \\n</p></blockquote><p>Mayor's Office spokeswoman Melissa Grace wrote in her own statement,&nbsp;\\\"As we work to end the use of cluster apartments, [the Department of Social Services] is in close contact with the State to ensure these homes are properly registered as rent regulated and tenants have the protections they are due by law. At the same time, City agencies are working hand-in-glove to identify buildings where HPD\\u2019s financing tools can be used to preserve and strengthen long-term affordability.\\\"</p><p>She noted that rent-stabilized apartments are not counted towards the mayor's goal of building or preserving 200,000 affordable apartments. Rather, the total reflects buildings where the owners have entered regulatory agreements with the city to ensure certain price levels over set periods of time.</p><p>Public Advocate Letitia James said that she has been talking to HRA and DHS head Steven Banks about the issue, and is planning a meeting with TPU Deputy Commissioner Richard White to go over it further. Asked if she sees how vacating apartments to create new shelter units is counterproductive, James said, \\\"Yes.\\\" She paused, then added, \\\"I could see your argument. I think it\\u2019s part of an overall plan as we build more affordable housing, which takes time. In the meantime we\\u2019re going to have to house these families, build as fast as we possibly can, and work with the state to address this issue.\\\"</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"170628GiulianiHomeless.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170628GiulianiHomeless.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"427\\\"><br><i> Rudy Giuliani, on TV, was a frequent target of advocates for homeless rights, including Steve Banks. (Roger Lemoyne/Getty)</i></div><p></p><p>Martin Oesterreich, the architect of the cluster site model, never expected things to get to this point. Now retired, Oesterreich served as former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's homeless services commissioner towards the end of Giuliani's tenure. Faced with a growing homeless population, a mayor more interested in <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/nyregion/judge-upholds-policy-on-arresting-the-homeless-who-sleep-in-boxes.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">locking up homeless people</a> than helping them, and a never-ending series of lawsuits from the <a href=\\\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/legalaidsociety\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Legal Aid Society</a> seeking to cement the right to shelter in New York City and improve conditions, Oesterreich had his work cut out for him. </p><p>\\\"It was never intended to be a permanent program,\\\" said Oesterreich of the cluster site program. \\\"What ended up happening was that there were occasional spikes\\u2014if you don\\u2019t have online capacity to absorb those spikes you need to do a couple of different things.\\\"</p><p>One option was putting homeless people in hotels. This, he said, is \\\"not a good option,\\\" because hotels lack facilities such as kitchenettes that are required in shelters. The problem of where to physically put people was so pronounced that, at one point, Giuliani administration officials considered placing families in a former Bronx jail. Bloomberg actually <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/14/nyregion/inner-circle-of-bloomberg-aides-put-homeless-shelter-in-old-jail.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">did</a>. Clusters, as we've seen, present their own issues.</p><p>\\\"The theory was originally to try to locate apartments as close together as possible, to cluster them in a particular neighborhood,\\\" Oesterreich said. \\\"From a management perspective, it represents a bunch of challenges. If you control an entire building you can ensure security, you can ensure on-site activities, you can ensure all sorts of services are provided. In a cluster site situation it becomes much more difficult.\\\"</p><p>Asked if he'd ever considered the potential for the program to incentivize tenant harassment and deregulate apartments when setting up the program, Oesterreich said, \\\"No. It was never an issue.\\\" He said he doubted that landlords would willingly trade reliable tenants for shelter residents and the baggage some of them carry. Then I told him how much the city is paying. </p><p>\\\"Wow...I don\\u2019t know how to respond to that,\\\" he said. \\\"I can understand now why low-income housing advocates would look at this and say, 'You\\u2019re distorting the market for regular people.' I could understand how they could get there. Astonishing.\\\"</p><p>Perhaps also astonishing is the rise of one of Oesterreich's chief antagonists, Legal Aid's Steven Banks, who worked on the litigation that established the right to shelter, to the job of de Blasio's homeless services commissioner. In that role, Banks faces many familiar criticisms, including slowness to address appalling shelter conditions, failure to reduce the shelter population, now at a record 60,000, and as the cluster program winds down without immediate capacity to replace lost units, over-reliance on hotels.</p><p>\\\"Schadenfreude is a phrase that could be used,\\\" Oesterreich said, adding that he wishes Banks the best. </p><p>Publicly, the current mayoral administration points to <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2011/09/14/city_doesnt_have_to_subsidize_rent.php\\\">voucher cuts by Governor Cuomo and Michael Bloomberg</a> and a lack of emphasis on affordable housing construction by Bloomberg and Giuliani as drivers of the homelessness crisis. Privately, some homeless services officials and providers say that they don't like relying on negligent landlords, but that until there are more shelters and more housing in reach of poor people, they have little choice. </p><p>Oesterreich agrees. He explained, \\\"If you continue looking for additional capacity, after a while the landlord figures out that there\\u2019s no way they\\u2019re going to close it down. They\\u2019ve got you by the short hairs.\\\"</p>\", \"text_more\": null, \"thumbnail_105\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2017/06/170628Bronx-thumb-105x105-1003345.jpg\", \"thumbnail_300\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2017/06/170628Bronx-thumb-300x300-1003345.jpg\", \"thumbnail_60\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2017/06/170628Bronx-thumb-60x60-1003345.jpg\", \"thumbnail_640\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2017/06/170628Bronx-thumb-640xauto-1003345.jpg\", \"title\": \"Thousands Of Rent-Stabilized Apartments At Risk As NYC Phases Out Controversial Homeless Shelter Program\", \"leadImage\": {\"src\": \"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170628Bronx.jpg\", \"caption\": \"The Bronx was home to 243 of the city's 330 cluster site homeless shelter buildings at one point during fiscal year 2016.\", \"credit\": \"<a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jes8jes/16627649111/in/photolist-4gBdJN-rkk3Mn-orVjQo-jYYpKY-8kaq8f-8KzwfJ-eivKgQ-b7BJCP-j492Dj-jYWCCp-khuh9d-j4759G-jYYtG5-irRCgZ-fPHPRV-eipgvs-jk4BPW-reCHYP-kWahzd-eivK6s-dYVEsM-nhLVfW-jfDcnb-juHTMP-k5u8vo-ehtvR9-qY9H2f-JeDXeH-avkgcr-iiaWWd-cmwRmf-NH35hA-ipLY1P-9p3qdx-9agfgA-93xk67-94WPX2-rcvxtb-nV71HF-owfWrR-fauVNV-beRsyX-cD5UPY-dcDsy3-ngV7Bq-9h8y5i-9gnU9X-99TDTP-jeeEaq-jrU8F7/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Jill Slater</a>/Flickr\", \"alt\": \"The Bronx was home to 243 of the city's 330 cluster site homeless shelter buildings at one point during fiscal year 2016.\"}}",

The pact states a commitment to reducing the rise in global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Farenheit above preindustrial levels, or 1.5 degrees if possible. It also outlines a commitment by industrialized countries, starting at $100 billion a year, to help industrializing countries switch to renewable energy sources and adapt to climate change. To accomplish an eventual peak in carbon emissions followed by reductions and a halt in the global temperature climb, signers agreed to reduce emissions, not right away, but starting in 2020. That year, participants are also supposed to submit a long-term plan outlining how they will accomplish the larger goals.</p><p>During the negotiations and following the deal, climate scientists and activists were quick to <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/11/voluntary_pledges_arent_enough_glaciologist_says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">point out</a> that the accord is essentially voluntary, as it carries no enforcement measures for those countries that fail to keep up their end of the bargain. Also, the world is already 0.9 degrees C warmer than preindustrial averages, and at current emission rates is projected to <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/11/paris-climate-change-conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rise above 2 degrees by 2050</a>, and over 4 degrees by 2100. Even a 2-degree increase, the putative goal of the climate pact, is projected to doom some Pacific Island nations, and put much of the U.S. coastline underwater, including substantial swaths of New York City.</p><p>Below is part of a map showing land less than 20 feet above the high-tide line, a level that the ocean is expected to rise eventually if not in the next century under a 2-degree Celsius increase.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"170602NYCSeaLevelRise2DegreesCelsius.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170602NYCSeaLevelRise2DegreesCelsius.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"391\"><br><i> (<a href=\"http://ss6m.climatecentral.org/#12/40.6073/-73.9421\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Climate Central</a>)</i></div><p></p><p>Meanwhile, 2016 was the third straight <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/global_warming_big_league.php\">hottest year on record</a>, sea levels around New York are <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/12/08/sea_levels_surrounding_nyc_could_ri.php\">projected to rise a foot by 2030</a>, and thousands of New Yorkers are <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/rising_heat_deaths_nyc.php\">predicted to die annually</a> from extreme summer heat by the 2080s if dramatic changes aren't made.</p><p>The worse news: Even under the specific emission reduction levels pledged under the Paris accord before the U.S. pulled out, the Earth would still <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/1/the_paris_agreement_will_see_the\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surpass a 2-degree increase</a>, cruising to around 3 degrees.

Bob Orlove, a senior research scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society and a professor at the Columbia School of International Public Affairs <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2017/06/02/climate_scientist_explainer_paris_accord.php\">told us</a>:</p><blockquote><p>City officials can, in some ways, make decisions that have stronger impacts on emissions than national leaders can.

No city accounts for even a tenth of that. And yet, cities are seeking to reduce their own emissions, I think because they recognize the importance of action in this area. </p></blockquote><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"170602AstoriaTrainBuildings.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170602AstoriaTrainBuildings.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\"><br><i> (<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeyone/8561653859/sizes/z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harris Graber</a>/Flickr)</i></div><p></p><p>As for New York, to paraphrase Ed Koch, how're we doing? Cuomo's car obsession and de Blasio's daily caravanning from the Upper East Side to Park Slope aside, if the world is going to heat up at a less alarming rate, it would do well to become more like New York City. New York City is home to more people than all but 11 states, according to New Yorker writer <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu/features/greenest_place_in_the_us_its_not_where_you_think\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Owen</a>, but if it were its own state it would rank 51st in per-capita energy consumption.</p><p>New York's density means that the average city household consumes less than half of the electricity of the average American household, and 54 percent of New Yorkers don't own a car.</p><p>In 2015, de Blasio updated Bloomberg's sustainability plan with <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2015/04/22/by_2030_de_blasio_wants_to_reduce_n.php\">the OneNYC initiative</a>, which aims to reduce the city's greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. It proposes to do this in large part by increasing buildings' energy efficiency—buildings account for almost three quarters of the city's carbon emissions—and by reducing the trash sent to landfills by 90 percent by 2030.</p><p>If the city is to maintain its status as a sustainability leader, its stewards are going to need to do more of this—<a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/styrofoamban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banning Styrofoam</a> would be a solid step, for example—and invest more in its <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2017/05/19/mta_cuomo_subway_broken.php\">crumbling public transit</a> and its cycling infrastructure.

It's not clear that a mechanism exists for such an unusual, non-nation conglomerate to be recognized by the U.N. in this context, but what is clear is that across much of the U.S. and among the leadership of <a href=\\\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/02/world/us-climate-world-reacts/index.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">practically every other country</a> in the world, Trump's decision is being met with righteous outrage.</p><p>The cleavage is perhaps best summarized in this tweet by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose use of \\\"the United States federal government\\\" echoes the longstanding distinction that anti-war activists draw between despots and the people they govern.</p><center><blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We are deeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/870386250762645504\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">June 1, 2017</a></p></blockquote><script async=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script></center><p>So what exactly is the Paris Climate Accord? </p><p>The climate agreement, <a href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/01/531048986/so-what-exactly-is-in-the-paris-climate-accord\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">signed in December 2015</a>, is remarkable more for the fact that 195 countries signed onto a document stating their commitment to reducing carbon emissions than for the force of its actual details. The pact states a commitment to reducing the rise in global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Farenheit above preindustrial levels, or 1.5 degrees if possible. It also outlines a commitment by industrialized countries, starting at $100 billion a year, to help industrializing countries switch to renewable energy sources and adapt to climate change. To accomplish an eventual peak in carbon emissions followed by reductions and a halt in the global temperature climb, signers agreed to reduce emissions, not right away, but starting in 2020. That year, participants are also supposed to submit a long-term plan outlining how they will accomplish the larger goals.</p><p>During the negotiations and following the deal, climate scientists and activists were quick to <a href=\\\"https://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/11/voluntary_pledges_arent_enough_glaciologist_says\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">point out</a> that the accord is essentially voluntary, as it carries no enforcement measures for those countries that fail to keep up their end of the bargain. Also, the world is already 0.9 degrees C warmer than preindustrial averages, and at current emission rates is projected to <a href=\\\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/11/paris-climate-change-conference\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">rise above 2 degrees by 2050</a>, and over 4 degrees by 2100. Even a 2-degree increase, the putative goal of the climate pact, is projected to doom some Pacific Island nations, and put much of the U.S. coastline underwater, including substantial swaths of New York City.</p><p>Below is part of a map showing land less than 20 feet above the high-tide line, a level that the ocean is expected to rise eventually if not in the next century under a 2-degree Celsius increase.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"170602NYCSeaLevelRise2DegreesCelsius.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170602NYCSeaLevelRise2DegreesCelsius.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"391\\\"><br><i> (<a href=\\\"http://ss6m.climatecentral.org/#12/40.6073/-73.9421\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Climate Central</a>)</i></div><p></p><p>Meanwhile, 2016 was the third straight <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/global_warming_big_league.php\\\">hottest year on record</a>, sea levels around New York are <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/12/08/sea_levels_surrounding_nyc_could_ri.php\\\">projected to rise a foot by 2030</a>, and thousands of New Yorkers are <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/rising_heat_deaths_nyc.php\\\">predicted to die annually</a> from extreme summer heat by the 2080s if dramatic changes aren't made.</p><p>The worse news: Even under the specific emission reduction levels pledged under the Paris accord before the U.S. pulled out, the Earth would still <a href=\\\"https://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/1/the_paris_agreement_will_see_the\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">surpass a 2-degree increase</a>, cruising to around 3 degrees.

No city accounts for even a tenth of that. And yet, cities are seeking to reduce their own emissions, I think because they recognize the importance of action in this area. </p></blockquote><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"170602AstoriaTrainBuildings.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/170602AstoriaTrainBuildings.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"479\\\"><br><i> (<a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeyone/8561653859/sizes/z/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Harris Graber</a>/Flickr)</i></div><p></p><p>As for New York, to paraphrase Ed Koch, how're we doing? Cuomo's car obsession and de Blasio's daily caravanning from the Upper East Side to Park Slope aside, if the world is going to heat up at a less alarming rate, it would do well to become more like New York City.

Lately, she's been taking the stairs a lot. Geist, who goes by Ronnie, has been involved in the center since shortly after it began as a feminist art collective in 1969. Since 1971, it has operated mostly out of several upper floors of a city-owned ten-story building in Hell's Kitchen, or Clinton, as some locals call it. </p><p></p><p>Over the last decade and a half, the building has deteriorated dramatically and the women of the arts center have been locked in litigation with the city and a nonprofit developer over the center's fate. In the process, Geist's job as director of special projects has become cataloging the calamities of a decaying century-old building, and trying to beat back dust and water that forced the center's retreat from whole floors of their space. Women's Interart lost its battle against eviction this spring, but as part of a settlement got six months to move out. Lacking a readily accessible elevator as the end approached, Geist walked up and down the stairs, trying to sort the center's files into some semblance of order for a move to...somewhere. </p><p>“If we’re compelled to leave, I think the Women's Interart Center will have taken its last breath,” said Margot Lewitin, the center's director and Geist's partner, in an interview in January. “We certainly do not have the resources to pick up and go somewhere else.\"</p><p>One lawsuit remains alive in a state appeals court, but on Monday the eviction became final. The arts center's stacks of flyers, film reels, and slide film, traces of performances and screenings by the likes of Eve Ensler, Shirley Clark, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/29/archives/adrienne-kennedy-decides-that-the-classrooms-the-thing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adrienne Kennedy</a> are being stored in a studio space in the Brooklyn Navy Yard awaiting an archive to take them. Lewitin, an ardent advocate for the group through its existence, objected late last week to the mild suggestion that the center is on hold.</p><p>“The Studio that we’re sharing in the Navy Yard is NOT a storage space, it is where we are preparing the files for the Library for the Performing Arts, but it is also where we will be working until we determine how we want to move forward,” she wrote.</p><p>Still, the Women's Interart Center, as it existed for nearly half a century, is dead.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-right\"><img alt=\"160920592West52Street.jpeg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160920592West52Street.jpeg\" width=\"360\" height=\"617\"><br><i style=\" width:360px; ;display:block\"> The former Women's Interart Center building at 549 West 52nd Street. (Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p> In the center's 45 years on 52nd Street, the neighborhood at large has gone from what Lewitin once described as “Berlin after the war” to a place where the median one-bedroom rent is $3,295 and glassy high-rises are continually poking skyward. The rise and fall of Women's Interart is more than just the story of an arts venue being priced out of a gentrifying neighborhood, though. The arts center's saga is inexorably intertwined with the history of the surrounding six-block area, which, if the city had not seized it in the middle of the 20th century at the tail end of its disastrous urban renewal program, would almost certainly be a wall of luxury residential towers by now. The blocks that comprise the former Clinton Urban Renewal Area offered those living and working in them a crash course in the evolution and contradictions of city housing policy, and depending on whom you talk to, a glimpse or a manifestation of what a determined group of everyday people can create in its place.</p><p></p><p>The city first took over the blocks from 50th to 56th streets between 10th and 11th avenues in 1969, in what would turn out to be one of the final acts of the urban renewal program. Begun in 1949 by the federal Urban Housing Act, urban renewal was the process by which cities nationwide undertook the wholesale demolition of poor neighborhoods with the stated intent of replaced them with new housing, highways, and civic centers. In New York City, famed wrecker of neighborhoods and builder of big things Robert Moses embraced the federal program with gusto, evicting 320,000 people by wrecking ball in 10 years, outspending all the rest of the cities in the country combined by two to one in the same period, and enriching politically connected contractors to cement his hold on power in the process. </p><p>Moses claimed to be relocating people displaced by the program into new public housing, but as the back-of-napkin math of watchdogs and later <em>Power Broker</em> author <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/17/robert_caro_author_interview.php\">Robert Caro</a> showed, only a tiny fraction of those displaced ended up in new housing, whereas elsewhere in the city other so-called slums were swelling with new arrivals.</p><p>In 1960, with urban renewal funding cuts coming and city employment rules restricting him from heading up the planning for the 1964 World's Fair, Moses quit the Mayor's Committee on Slum Clearance. The coming decade was the stage for growing public resistance to urban renewal. In 1963, James Baldwin famously decried urban renewal, which displaced more than 100,000 African American New Yorkers, as “negro removal.” Jane Jacobs published her seminal book <em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em> in 1961. In it, she advocated against the dominant brand of top-down urban planning that sees neighborhoods as made up of discreet building blocks rather than intricately interwoven swaths of urban fabric. </p><p>The blocks that make up the Clinton Urban Renewal Area were a mixture of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/28/archives/raku-an-ancient-craft-and-ceramic-fantasy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brownstones and factory buildings</a>. Just five years later, Richard Nixon ended the urban renewal program altogether. Instead of building housing, the city had created an expanse of newly abandoned buildings. In Clinton, some former building owners managed to stay on, renting space in the same structures that had been formally taken from them. Many buildings, though, sat empty. The city had a new kind of problem on its hands.</p><p>“A number of properties were taken through the old urban renewal program in the '50s and '60s, and the money was never there to redevelop, and the real estate market was collapsing in the ‘70s,” said Joseph Shuldiner, a deputy commissioner at the Housing Department in the 1980s, and now head of Yonkers's public housing authority. “There was no money to redevelop the property.”</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160915WICNYTimes730321.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160915WICNYTimes730321.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\"><br><i> (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/21/archives/women-activism-turns-to-alternatives-in-arts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York Times</a>)</i></div><p></p><p>The Women's Interart Center formed in 1969 as more of an idea than a venue, one of many women's collectives formed amid the heady ferment of feminist activism in New York City at the time. As Lewitin recalls, the group, founded as a non-hierarchical collective, was meeting in members' homes when a painter named Rose mentioned the buildings in Hell's Kitchen that were just sitting there, and proposed trying to move into one. </p><p>A call to Housing found a sympathetic audience with the man in charge of commercial leasing, and that summer the center established its first brick-and-mortar location on the 10th floor of 549 West 52nd. The rent: $50 a month.</p><p>The women got to work clearing cobwebs and building out the space, and by 1976 they had expanded to five floors of the building, plus a floor of a building down the block. </p><p>“Because we were a multi-arts organization, we really needed a lot of space,” Lewitin said. Their compound included workshops for silk-screening, ceramics, painting, film, and a new technology called video. On the 10th floor, with the help of an architect donating her time, they built a theater space and a gallery. </p><p>“We had a whole array of programs because the idea was that artists should not feel stuck in their area of concentration...The whole concept of multimedia work was not what it is today. People were concerned, if they were painters and they tried, say, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/14/archives/videotape-replaces-canvas-for-artists-who-use-tv-technology-in-new.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>, they were concerned about being seen not as an artist but as a craftsperson.”</p><p>Lewitin shies away from applying the label \"feminist\" to the enterprise, saying instead that the center operated on the principle “that women artists need a place to experiment, to produce work, to get that work out before the public.” Men could participate, but women were the focus, she explained. </p><p>With these ideas in mind, and an eerie wasteland outside their many windows, the more than 100 members of the arts center worked through the 1970s. The center served as an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/19/archives/stage-kay-carneys-off-off-broadway-reprise.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Off Off Broadway launchpad</a> for performers including Eve Ensler, who would go on to write <em>The Vagina Monologues,</em> and Joyce Aaron, who won an Obie in 1976 for her play at the center that year, <em>Acrobatics</em>.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160919AcrobaticsWIC.JPG\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919AcrobaticsWIC.JPG\" width=\"640\" height=\"412\"><br><i> Playwright, actor, and director Joyce Aaron won an Obie for her play <em>Acrobatics</em>, staged at the Women's Interart Center. (Courtesy of WIC)</i></div><p></p><p>They worked without much help from the city, Lewitin said.\t</p><p>“The building at its best was not in great condition, and it got worse,” she said. Mayor Lindsay left office in 1974, and with him, any semblance of a functional landlord relationship with the city. “When the administrations changed, subsequent mayors were not the least bit interested in maintaining the building for what we were doing,” she said.</p><p>Nearby in the renewal area footprint, others carried on, too. Downstairs in 549 West 52nd, the Ensemble Studio Theater joined WIC in the building and built a name around its one-act play festival. Soundscape, a jazz and world-music concert production company, followed too, organizing shows and renting space to sculptors. A block over, on 51st Street, the Irish Arts Center developed its programming, which included dance, theater, comedy, and music performances; film screenings; and Irish language classes. Downtown, artists with organizations such as the experimental theater La MaMa and other hearty souls were clinging to similar arrangements in an urban renewal area around East Fourth Street. </p><p>The workaday businesses carried on too, including a tire shop, lumber store, auto body shop, and a taxi meter repair shop. </p><p>The period wasn't entirely quiet on the development front. Using what meager funds were left from the feds, the city razed dozens of homes and built three projects by 1980, two towers under the Mitchel-Lama program for middle-income families, and a public housing complex.</p><p>The first development proposal to galvanize the neighborhood in opposition was one proposed under Mayor Ed Koch in the early 1980s. The plan called for building luxury towers at 10th Avenue and 52nd Street. The development would contain more than 600 apartments, 20 percent of the units set aside as below-market-rate. It also called for demolishing the arts building near 11th Avenue to make way for commercial tenants displaced by the development. Koch even had specific developers lined up. All he needed was to make it through the city's review process. </p><p>Through a vigorous, organized showing at public meetings, in the press, and in calls to people with lines to power, locals made sure that didn't happen. Lewitin said that left an impression on city housing commissioners.</p><p>“We defeated that plan, and it presented a real danger to the way in which development is done in the city,” she said.</p><p>Joe Restuccia, director of the nonprofit housing developer Clinton Housing Development Company and another Hell's Kitchen fixture who has, as he put it, \"gotten old with the project,\" said after Koch's plan was defeated he, like Lindsay before him, shunned the neighborhood. \"Koch was like, 'Fuck you' to the neighborhood, and he wouldn’t do anything. All these buildings just hung around forever.\"</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-right\"><img alt=\"160919ClintonMasterPlan.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919ClintonMasterPlan.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"351\"><br><i style=\" width:359px; ;display:block\"> The Clinton Master Plan won a National AIA Award and set the tone for the next quarter century of development in the neighborhood. (Peterson Littenberg)</i></div><p> Newly organized under the banner of the Clinton Preservation Local Development Company, part of the Clinton locals' strategy for fending off newly adamant calls for development was to create a plan to counter Koch's, a tactic that echoed that of the downtown Cooper Square Committee, which prevailed in a similar battle a decade prior. The Clinton community plan would include affordable housing, but in contrast to the city's clean sweep approach, it would preserve much of the existing building stock, and keep the tenants where they were, more or less. </p><p></p><p>If there was a time to get organized to preserve the neighborhood, the mid-1980s was it. The economic desperation of the 1970s was beginning to fade, and development was moving in. Donald Trump first proposed building the complex that would become Riverside South on a former railyard between 59th and 72nd streets in 1974. He floundered without financing, and tried again starting in 1982. (His finances in peril, Trump sold part of the project to a group of Hong Kong and Chinese investors in 1994.) Meanwhile, the city and developers were plotting ways to dislodge the sex industry from the Theater District.\t</p><p>“We knew Trump was coming down from the north, and 42nd Street was coming up from the south, and eventually 11th Avenue was gonna become an important street,” said architect <a href=\"http://petersonlittenberg.com/about/barbara-littenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Barbara Littenberg</a>.</p><p>The group retained the services of Littenberg and partner Steven Peterson and came up with a detailed, utopian vision for the neighborhood, wherein the low-rise buildings would remain intact with a mixture of uses closest to the street and housing towers would be built behind, with room left for elaborate courtyards and parks in the center of the blocks. The plan also called on the city to sell the buildings to qualifying long-time tenants, and proposed a scheme for pricing the sales in such a way that committed commercial owners would subsidize the construction of housing. This was supposed to make it possible to build towers with just 40 percent market-rate apartment and 60 percent permanently below-market, and to keep arts tenants at modest rents, according to Lewitin. </p><p>The Women's Interart Center attached a plan of their own to this one, proposing gut-renovating the entire 10-story building it occupied, and expanding into three vacant lots, ultimately adding a 499-seat theater, an eight-story addition to the existing building—to house rehearsal studios—and a cafe.</p><p>The process of developing the plan was transcendent, according to Littenberg.</p><p>“It was the most incredible experience because you have these blue-collar people, and you have these arty people, and they all got on the same page,” she said. “We had this huge model, and we said, 'You go here. You go here'...Everyone got the sense that this was possible.”</p><p>That isn't to say that everyone involved in the plan was working from a precisely shared vision. Littenberg recalled having to be careful with her plan displays around Lewitin.</p><p>“I remember the community was so anti-high-rise, I would bring the model over in sections,” Littenberg said. “If Margot came by and saw it she'd say, 'Nope, that's too tall. That has got to go.' She would take the tops off of my towers.”</p><p>The plan would go on to win an American Institute of Architects Award, but at the city level, it wasn't an easy sell. The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development dismissed the community plan as impractical. In 1984, the same year the Clinton tenants came out with their plan, the department tried to raise their rents dramatically—by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/18/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-241725.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as much as 2,000 percent</a>.</p><p>“It was a recognition by the city that they had for 20 years kept up the fiction they were going to redevelop the property,” said Shuldiner, the '80s-era deputy HPD commissioner who broke the news of the proposed increases. When the tenants balked, Shuldiner and his colleagues negotiated a settlement that was meant to more fairly compensate the city for managing the thousands of buildings it was the reluctant landlord of, without driving the tenants out.  </p><p>“Mr.  Koch was famous for saying, 'No free lunch,'” Shuldiner said. “Some people within HPD thought we were giving free lunch.” </p><p>Nevertheless, Koch signed off on the settlement. By <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/arts/arts-groups-oppose-plan-for-clinton.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1985</a>, WIC was paying $1,300 a month for four and a half floors. Geist estimates they had put $100,000 into the space by that point. Lewitin was also several years into a pitch to the city to buy the building for $400,000, and though the housing commissioner at the time reportedly expressed interest, the agency got cold feet over a philosophical difference: HPD, the housing agency, is focused on housing, rather than neighborhoods in all their complexity.</p><p>''I don't think we're ready to do it with them,'' assistant HPD Commissioner Charles Perkins <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/arts/arts-groups-oppose-plan-for-clinton.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told the Times in 1985</a>. ''With the need for housing that there is, we believe the site is better used for housing.''</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160919ClintonMasterPlanBeforeAfter.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919ClintonMasterPlanBeforeAfter.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\"><br><i> The community spirit of the 1980s may have faded away, but the zoning created by the Clinton Master Plan has shaped the way the neighborhood has developed since 1994. (Littenberg Peterson)</i></div><p></p><p>Things remained much the same after Koch pulled out of the neighborhood. In 1994, faced with what to gadflies was the disaster of the city suddenly moving 60 sanitation trucks to Hell's Kitchen, the local community board <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chelsea-clinton-a-tradeoff-trucks-for-housing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reached a deal with the city</a>: the neighborhood would temporarily house the trucks, which no other neighborhood wanted, in exchange for renovating six buildings in the urban renewal area and expediting WIC's ongoing quest to purchase its building, among other items.</p><p>Momentum was in the Clinton residents' favor that year. With Rudolph Giuliani in the mayor's office, a version of the community plan passed the final hurdle of the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, the same process that felled Koch's luxury tower plan a decade earlier. The approval covered WIC's proposed expansion, and an amendment to the urban renewal area allowed for the sale of 549 and the neighboring lots.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-right\"><img alt=\"160920CybertTire.jpeg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160920CybertTire.jpeg\" width=\"360\" height=\"640\"><br><i style=\" width:360px; ;display:block\">The century-old tire shop Cybert Tire is getting a dedicated space in a massive new mixed-income development being built by Clinton Housing Development Company and for-profit developers Taconic Investment Partners and Ritterman Capital. (Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p> What happened next was, Littenberg remembers, “a free-for-all.” It also laid the groundwork for the conflict that would cost Women's Interart its home.</p><p></p><p>Restuccia agitated alongside Lewitin to stop the city's wrecking balls and attain community control, but would later become Women's Interarts property manager and take part in the fight to push them out. On the surface, there is little obvious conflict between the visions of the two. Both want the urban renewal area to be a place for affordable housing, and to protect the arts organizations, longtime businesses and residents, and, where feasible, buildings. And yet, they have fought like crazy.</p><p>In Lewitin's telling, the years since 1994 have been an exercise in cynical collusion between various city agencies, local affordable housing developer <a href=\"http://clintonhousing.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clinton Housing Development Company</a>, and those in the neighborhood willing to go along with the official program, even though it ran counter to the goals of the community plan of that era. </p><p>Restuccia's group, meanwhile, has had a remarkable run, using government and investor money, and occasionally partnering with outside real estate firms to develop hundreds of units of low and moderate-income housing, and supportive housing for formerly homeless people in four developments. Other developers, too, have channeled government grants and private investment to, with the blessing of many in the urban renewal area but not an increasingly estranged Lewitin and Geist, senior and other low-income housing. </p><p>The flood of construction ended a quiet five years after the community plan became the law of the land. </p><p>After the victories of 1994, Restuccia said, \"The community sat and could not get it together. They had developed a really good and creative plan for how to solve the problem. As for executing, they couldn’t do it.\" In 1999, many neighborhood stakeholders convened once more and agreed to, as Restuccia explains it, \"take the concepts of the mega-plan and now make them into small, doable sections.\" The problem of the 1994 plan was, he said, that all of the financing, all of the functions, \"Everything tied into the entire thing.\" </p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160920ClintonHousingUrbanRenewal.jpeg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160920ClintonHousingUrbanRenewal.jpeg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"><br><i> The building housing the Women's Interart Center, in blue, is the last undeveloped lot on that half of the block, surrounded by new projects that all include some portion of below-market housing.

In a 27-story high-rise like the Avalon Clinton on WIC's block, 10s of thousands of square feet are set aside for nonprofit theater groups. Lewitin, though, is fixated on the 80 percent market-rate, 20 percent-below-market split in the building's apartments, a hallmark of the city's broader developer-driven approach to affordable housing.</p><p>\"The Community Plan demonstrated how to redevelop WITHOUT gentrification, creating affordable apartments in a truly mixed-use community, with open spaces, gardens and cultural vibrancy,” Lewitin wrote in a wistful email early this year.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160919DoctoroffBloomberg.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919DoctoroffBloomberg.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\"><br><i> Dan Doctoroff, left, was Mayor Michael Bloomberg's deputy mayor for development. The Economic Development Corporation under Doctoroff terminated a contract that would have allowed WIC to expand. (Thomas Cooper/Getty)</i></div><p></p><p>Viewed another way, the demise of Women's Interart Center can be traced back to stubbornness, on the part of the city, and of the center.</p><p>“She’s an amazing woman,” Littenberg said of Lewitin. “She was very much a very active player, very articulate, very dynamic in getting the whole thing together, and she spoke very eloquently. ... She also made a lot of enemies in the process, so it doesn’t surprise me that they wouldn’t accommodate her. It’s sad.”</p><p>Lewitin regrets some of her past bluster, saying she reads old news stories and finds her comments “anything but prudent. At one point I described HPD as a criminal enterprise.”</p><p>On the most local level, WIC spent two decades trying to buy its building, and almost succeeded. The plan for a purchase and expansion was approved. In theory, all that the center had to do was come up with the money to finance the purchase and construction.</p><p>According to Lewitin, the first round of pledged state funding fell through when Governor George Pataki took office in 1995 and ordered a stop on development spending for projects that hadn't broken ground. Starting in 1988, WIC withheld rent on and off, complaining about unfixed leaks, broken boilers and radiators, and broken windows. Both sides took each other to court, and they repeatedly settled. Public criticisms of the direction the community plan was heading in did not help assuage the bad blood.</p><p>Proposed temporary relocation arrangements for their arts neighbors in the building didn't go over well, according to court filings, with the Ensemble Studio Theater proving particularly resistant to a temporary eviction for WIC's ends, and HPD refusing to formally evict them. The theater, which briefly tried to sue WIC and the city in the early 2000s, declined to comment. The EDC by all reports remained on board with the WIC plan through 2001.</p><p>Lewitin says her team again had funding lined up, this time in the form of $14 million in HUD loans and a $2 million grant from the city's Economic Development Corporation. A contract executed in August 2001 memorialized the plan for WIC to buy the building, for $2. The closing, Lewitin said, was delayed by the September 11th attacks, and according to court filings, by WIC continuing to line up funding. Lewitin claims that the incoming Bloomberg administration's general antipathy to community-based development, and WIC's opposition to a proposed <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/urbandev/features/9307/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">West Side stadium and Olympic complex</a> in particular soured Bloomberg's economic development czar Dan Doctoroff on the deal. An HPD spokeswoman said that WIC didn't have the additional $5 million it needed to put up to do the deal, but a federal judge's exhaustive timeline of the negotiations does not mention this. </p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160919WICBlueprint.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919WICBlueprint.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"><br><i> Architectural drawings show WIC's planned expansion. (Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>In 2002, Doctoroff's EDC canceled the contract.</p><p>The collapse of the deal kicked off a series of legal battles that are still going on today. WIC sued in federal court for breach of contract. </p><p> In subsequent litigation, the EDC and HPD cited WIC's history of rent nonpayment as evidence that the center could not be trusted to fund the project on a federal grant alone, predicting the city would eventually have to cover the costs.</p><p>A March 2002 memo from EDC advisor Laurel Blatchford and deputy Roy Bahat to Deputy Mayor Doctoroff seems to undercut that claim. It reads:</p><blockquote><p>As per our discussion last week about Women’s Interart Center:\n\n</p><p>While the current financing structure does entail some risk to the city should WIC<br>\ndefault on the $16M in CDBG loans, the financing package that WIC has<br>\nassembled meets the city’s criteria. Moreover, according to EDC, WIC has met<br>\nevery requirement that they have set along the way to ensure that the financing is<br>\nsound.</p><p>At this point, it appears that the political cost of pulling the plug is quite high. In<br>\naddition, we could effectively pull the plug and ensure that WIC’s financing<br>\ncollapsed by stalling, a path of action that would incur even greater political costs.<br></p></blockquote><p></p><p>An independent audit commissioned by the EDC concluded that the complex \"seem[ed] to meet current standards\" and that the rehearsal spaces \"should be in demand\" enough to support the project financially. </p><p>The disparities between the internal communications and the reasons later stated for ending the contract “raise questions as to what occurred in the interim,” New York Supreme Court judge Karen Smith wrote in a 2010 decision.</p><p>Doctoroff declined to comment through a spokesman. CHDC did not respond to comment requests made by email and a message left with a receptionist.</p><p>After WIC lost in federal court, HPD brought in Restuccia's CHDC, to manage the building in 2007, and he brought eviction proceedings against them.  WIC renewed the fight in civil court, adding Clinton Housing to the docket.</p><p>As the litigation got going, the building's problems, always an issue, were becoming dramatically more pronounced. Already, in 1996, the passenger elevator had broken on the opening night of one of Lewitin's plays in 549, forcing the center to hire elevator operators for the run. On the final night, she said, the freight elevator broke too, stranding lights and other borrowed heavy equipment on the 10th floor.  </p><p>“I said, 'We're never doing another play on this floor until we own the building and have gutted it and renovated it,'” Lewitin recalled. They moved their plays to an auxiliary space in another building at the corner of 10th Avenue.</p><p>The collapse of the deal continued the drumbeat of misfortune and conflict with the city and Clinton Housing, which WIC has now for all practical purposes lost. </p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160919WICSlides.jpeg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919WICSlides.jpeg\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\"><br><i> Slides from the WIC archives, for which the center's leaders are now seeking a home. (Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>In 2002, a water tower on the roof burst, sending water pouring through the skylight and any other permeable roof seam onto the 10th floor, and cascading down the stairs to the ninth, according to Geist. Whatever hope there had been of restoring the 10th floor theater was dashed long-term, and the gallery was destroyed. The space remains partially gutted and smells of decay. The water tower collapsed again in 2003, according to Geist. </p><p>The only remaining fully usable floor was the seventh, according to WIC. Based on what they considered a denial of services, they again withheld rent. Lacking a theater, Lewitin says they took apart their shop and renovated the space to see if they could supplement their income, primarily from grants, by renting office space short-term to film companies shooting in New York. (HPD and Restuccia say WIC was using these and other subletters to simply pad their pockets while withholding the nominal rent. The subletting violated WIC's lease, according to a federal judge's decision. Lewitin maintains that the TV business was a test-run to see if it could help support the complex she still dreamed of.) Then, in October of 2010, she says “CHDC pulled all of our elevators out and that was that.” </p><p>She says the group, acting as a property manager for HPD, closed the passenger elevator instead of repairing it, then reduced the freight elevator, which requires a certified operator, to 40 hours a week, charging tenants $15 an hour for usage outside of those hours, making the TV industry side business impossible.</p><p>HPD filed to evict WIC from the corner outpost where its resident theater troupe Blessed Unrest was staging productions. That eviction went through first, this past winter, ending WIC's public-facing events.</p><p>“I got quite an education in our legal system,” Geist told me as we toured what was left of the arts center in June. “Not that I wanted one, but I got one.”</p><p>The litigation held up a <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb4/downloads/pdf/Resolutions/JANUARY%202011/3%20CHKLU%20Letter%20to%20HPD%20re%20Clinton%20Commons.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">project called Clinton Commons</a>, a proposed 103-unit below-market condo development reserved for households making $38,016 to $130,680. The project was supposed to occupy the vacant lots Lewitin had her eye on for expansion, and the lawsuits put a cloud on the title.</p><p>Lewitin no longer gets out as much, but she's defiant and eternally optimistic about the next legal move, no matter how often her lawyers tell her they don't have a chance. Hence, after agreeing this March to an eviction settlement that gave them six months, or until August 31st to move out, WIC didn't leave without a fight. With that battle lost, the center has returned to yet another appeal. </p><p>Reached on the day of the eviction, Restuccia was reflective. \"I just feel bad for them,\" he said of Geist and Lewitin. Restuccia said that his goal was not to drive them out but to get them to negotiate some more modest vision for the building's future, to be shared with the other arts institutions downstairs. He added that he studied theater as a young man and knew of and admired the work of Women's Interart. The '90s marked a turning point for the center's output and its leaders' sense of their place in the community, he said.</p><p>\"When they got involved in this whole thing with making this building an arts center they lost their way,\" he said. \"They just lost perspective on this project.\"</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160919WICModel.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919WICModel.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\"><br><i> A waterlogged model of WIC's proposed expansion. (Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>At some moments, even Lewitin, ever the fighter, can't help but feel frustrated by all that's happened.</p><p>“I hate to acknowledge it, but I’m getting really old,” Lewitin said. “I was trying to get this damn thing up and built so I could turn it over to the next generation of leadership.”</p><p>CHDC has told the remaining arts tenants that there will be a home for them in whatever comes next. The sad irony, Restuccia said, is that the project he and others have in mind—an all-arts and cultural complex with added rehearsal space—is \"in essence the vision that [WIC] had in a more reduced, modest version.\" He has no doubt the project will happen.</p><p>As I toured what was left of the space with Geist in June, the knicknacks hanging on the unfinished wall, the odor of wet wood, and the undone dishes around the ninth floor sink struck me as something that would be familiar to anyone who has spent time in a squat, or a collective art space in a formerly industrial building. Such spaces, for those without industrial tools of construction and access to the great fortunes they take to operate, are stubbornly temporary, their entropy constantly accelerating. This only becomes more apparent as time passes. The roofs leak. The walls and appliances drop soot on your precious belongings. Once-crisp boards sag beneath your feet.</p><p>In the painting studio, one last lively corner of the ninth floor along with the ceramics studio opposite, abstract painter Martin Mullin was at work, placing a layer of seal over freshly cracked gold leaf on a large canvas. Mullin modeled the red construction earmuffs he wears to block out the sound of construction on the surrounding lots of a two-building, block-through, Clinton Housing and Taconic Investment project containing 595 apartments, 414 of them market rate. “It's great,” Mullin said, voice rising as he donned the muffs. “You can't even hear your own body!”</p><p>I took a photo, then followed Geist into a nearby open area. Beyond stacks of film reels, sitting on a moving box, was a cardboard mockup of WIC's planned expansion. </p><p>“It's so water-damaged,” Geist said. “You shouldn't take a photo of it.” </p><p>“Isn't that kind of apt?” I asked.</p><p>“Be careful now,” she said. “You don't want to say anything that'd make me cry.”</p>"

(Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p> In the center's 45 years on 52nd Street, the neighborhood at large has gone from what Lewitin once described as \\u201cBerlin after the war\\u201d to a place where the median one-bedroom rent is $3,295 and glassy high-rises are continually poking skyward. The rise and fall of Women's Interart is more than just the story of an arts venue being priced out of a gentrifying neighborhood, though. The arts center's saga is inexorably intertwined with the history of the surrounding six-block area, which, if the city had not seized it in the middle of the 20th century at the tail end of its disastrous urban renewal program, would almost certainly be a wall of luxury residential towers by now. The blocks that comprise the former Clinton Urban Renewal Area offered those living and working in them a crash course in the evolution and contradictions of city housing policy, and depending on whom you talk to, a glimpse or a manifestation of what a determined group of everyday people can create in its place.</p><p></p><p>The city first took over the blocks from 50th to 56th streets between 10th and 11th avenues in 1969, in what would turn out to be one of the final acts of the urban renewal program. Begun in 1949 by the federal Urban Housing Act, urban renewal was the process by which cities nationwide undertook the wholesale demolition of poor neighborhoods with the stated intent of replaced them with new housing, highways, and civic centers. In New York City, famed wrecker of neighborhoods and builder of big things Robert Moses embraced the federal program with gusto, evicting 320,000 people by wrecking ball in 10 years, outspending all the rest of the cities in the country combined by two to one in the same period, and enriching politically connected contractors to cement his hold on power in the process. </p><p>Moses claimed to be relocating people displaced by the program into new public housing, but as the back-of-napkin math of watchdogs and later <em>Power Broker</em> author <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/17/robert_caro_author_interview.php\\\">Robert Caro</a> showed, only a tiny fraction of those displaced ended up in new housing, whereas elsewhere in the city other so-called slums were swelling with new arrivals.</p><p>In 1960, with urban renewal funding cuts coming and city employment rules restricting him from heading up the planning for the 1964 World's Fair, Moses quit the Mayor's Committee on Slum Clearance. The coming decade was the stage for growing public resistance to urban renewal. In 1963, James Baldwin famously decried urban renewal, which displaced more than 100,000 African American New Yorkers, as \\u201cnegro removal.\\u201d Jane Jacobs published her seminal book <em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em> in 1961. In it, she advocated against the dominant brand of top-down urban planning that sees neighborhoods as made up of discreet building blocks rather than intricately interwoven swaths of urban fabric. </p><p>The blocks that make up the Clinton Urban Renewal Area were a mixture of <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/28/archives/raku-an-ancient-craft-and-ceramic-fantasy.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">brownstones and factory buildings</a>. Just five years later, Richard Nixon ended the urban renewal program altogether. Instead of building housing, the city had created an expanse of newly abandoned buildings. In Clinton, some former building owners managed to stay on, renting space in the same structures that had been formally taken from them. Many buildings, though, sat empty. The city had a new kind of problem on its hands.</p><p>\\u201cA number of properties were taken through the old urban renewal program in the '50s and '60s, and the money was never there to redevelop, and the real estate market was collapsing in the \\u201870s,\\u201d said Joseph Shuldiner, a deputy commissioner at the Housing Department in the 1980s, and now head of Yonkers's public housing authority. \\u201cThere was no money to redevelop the property.\\u201d</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160915WICNYTimes730321.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160915WICNYTimes730321.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"361\\\"><br><i> (<a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/21/archives/women-activism-turns-to-alternatives-in-arts.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">New York Times</a>)</i></div><p></p><p>The Women's Interart Center formed in 1969 as more of an idea than a venue, one of many women's collectives formed amid the heady ferment of feminist activism in New York City at the time. As Lewitin recalls, the group, founded as a non-hierarchical collective, was meeting in members' homes when a painter named Rose mentioned the buildings in Hell's Kitchen that were just sitting there, and proposed trying to move into one. </p><p>A call to Housing found a sympathetic audience with the man in charge of commercial leasing, and that summer the center established its first brick-and-mortar location on the 10th floor of 549 West 52nd. The rent: $50 a month.</p><p>The women got to work clearing cobwebs and building out the space, and by 1976 they had expanded to five floors of the building, plus a floor of a building down the block. </p><p>\\u201cBecause we were a multi-arts organization, we really needed a lot of space,\\u201d Lewitin said. Their compound included workshops for silk-screening, ceramics, painting, film, and a new technology called video. On the 10th floor, with the help of an architect donating her time, they built a theater space and a gallery. </p><p>\\u201cWe had a whole array of programs because the idea was that artists should not feel stuck in their area of concentration...The whole concept of multimedia work was not what it is today. People were concerned, if they were painters and they tried, say, <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/14/archives/videotape-replaces-canvas-for-artists-who-use-tv-technology-in-new.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">video</a>, they were concerned about being seen not as an artist but as a craftsperson.\\u201d</p><p>Lewitin shies away from applying the label \\\"feminist\\\" to the enterprise, saying instead that the center operated on the principle \\u201cthat women artists need a place to experiment, to produce work, to get that work out before the public.\\u201d Men could participate, but women were the focus, she explained. </p><p>With these ideas in mind, and an eerie wasteland outside their many windows, the more than 100 members of the arts center worked through the 1970s. The center served as an <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/19/archives/stage-kay-carneys-off-off-broadway-reprise.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Off Off Broadway launchpad</a> for performers including Eve Ensler, who would go on to write <em>The Vagina Monologues,</em> and Joyce Aaron, who won an Obie in 1976 for her play at the center that year, <em>Acrobatics</em>.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160919AcrobaticsWIC.JPG\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919AcrobaticsWIC.JPG\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"412\\\"><br><i> Playwright, actor, and director Joyce Aaron won an Obie for her play <em>Acrobatics</em>, staged at the Women's Interart Center.

Mayor Lindsay left office in 1974, and with him, any semblance of a functional landlord relationship with the city. \\u201cWhen the administrations changed, subsequent mayors were not the least bit interested in maintaining the building for what we were doing,\\u201d she said.</p><p>Nearby in the renewal area footprint, others carried on, too. Downstairs in 549 West 52nd, the Ensemble Studio Theater joined WIC in the building and built a name around its one-act play festival. Soundscape, a jazz and world-music concert production company, followed too, organizing shows and renting space to sculptors. A block over, on 51st Street, the Irish Arts Center developed its programming, which included dance, theater, comedy, and music performances; film screenings; and Irish language classes. Downtown, artists with organizations such as the experimental theater La MaMa and other hearty souls were clinging to similar arrangements in an urban renewal area around East Fourth Street. </p><p>The workaday businesses carried on too, including a tire shop, lumber store, auto body shop, and a taxi meter repair shop. </p><p>The period wasn't entirely quiet on the development front. Using what meager funds were left from the feds, the city razed dozens of homes and built three projects by 1980, two towers under the Mitchel-Lama program for middle-income families, and a public housing complex.</p><p>The first development proposal to galvanize the neighborhood in opposition was one proposed under Mayor Ed Koch in the early 1980s. The plan called for building luxury towers at 10th Avenue and 52nd Street. The development would contain more than 600 apartments, 20 percent of the units set aside as below-market-rate. It also called for demolishing the arts building near 11th Avenue to make way for commercial tenants displaced by the development. Koch even had specific developers lined up. All he needed was to make it through the city's review process. </p><p>Through a vigorous, organized showing at public meetings, in the press, and in calls to people with lines to power, locals made sure that didn't happen. Lewitin said that left an impression on city housing commissioners.</p><p>\\u201cWe defeated that plan, and it presented a real danger to the way in which development is done in the city,\\u201d she said.</p><p>Joe Restuccia, director of the nonprofit housing developer Clinton Housing Development Company and another Hell's Kitchen fixture who has, as he put it, \\\"gotten old with the project,\\\" said after Koch's plan was defeated he, like Lindsay before him, shunned the neighborhood. \\\"Koch was like, 'Fuck you' to the neighborhood, and he wouldn\\u2019t do anything. All these buildings just hung around forever.\\\"</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-right\\\"><img alt=\\\"160919ClintonMasterPlan.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919ClintonMasterPlan.jpg\\\" width=\\\"359\\\" height=\\\"351\\\"><br><i style=\\\" width:359px; ;display:block\\\"> The Clinton Master Plan won a National AIA Award and set the tone for the next quarter century of development in the neighborhood. (Peterson Littenberg)</i></div><p> Newly organized under the banner of the Clinton Preservation Local Development Company, part of the Clinton locals' strategy for fending off newly adamant calls for development was to create a plan to counter Koch's, a tactic that echoed that of the downtown Cooper Square Committee, which prevailed in a similar battle a decade prior. The Clinton community plan would include affordable housing, but in contrast to the city's clean sweep approach, it would preserve much of the existing building stock, and keep the tenants where they were, more or less. </p><p></p><p>If there was a time to get organized to preserve the neighborhood, the mid-1980s was it. The economic desperation of the 1970s was beginning to fade, and development was moving in. Donald Trump first proposed building the complex that would become Riverside South on a former railyard between 59th and 72nd streets in 1974. He floundered without financing, and tried again starting in 1982. (His finances in peril, Trump sold part of the project to a group of Hong Kong and Chinese investors in 1994.) Meanwhile, the city and developers were plotting ways to dislodge the sex industry from the Theater District.\\t</p><p>\\u201cWe knew Trump was coming down from the north, and 42nd Street was coming up from the south, and eventually 11th Avenue was gonna become an important street,\\u201d said architect <a href=\\\"http://petersonlittenberg.com/about/barbara-littenberg/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Barbara Littenberg</a>.</p><p>The group retained the services of Littenberg and partner Steven Peterson and came up with a detailed, utopian vision for the neighborhood, wherein the low-rise buildings would remain intact with a mixture of uses closest to the street and housing towers would be built behind, with room left for elaborate courtyards and parks in the center of the blocks. The plan also called on the city to sell the buildings to qualifying long-time tenants, and proposed a scheme for pricing the sales in such a way that committed commercial owners would subsidize the construction of housing. This was supposed to make it possible to build towers with just 40 percent market-rate apartment and 60 percent permanently below-market, and to keep arts tenants at modest rents, according to Lewitin. </p><p>The Women's Interart Center attached a plan of their own to this one, proposing gut-renovating the entire 10-story building it occupied, and expanding into three vacant lots, ultimately adding a 499-seat theater, an eight-story addition to the existing building\\u2014to house rehearsal studios\\u2014and a cafe.</p><p>The process of developing the plan was transcendent, according to Littenberg.</p><p>\\u201cIt was the most incredible experience because you have these blue-collar people, and you have these arty people, and they all got on the same page,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe had this huge model, and we said, 'You go here. You go here'...Everyone got the sense that this was possible.\\u201d</p><p>That isn't to say that everyone involved in the plan was working from a precisely shared vision. Littenberg recalled having to be careful with her plan displays around Lewitin.</p><p>\\u201cI remember the community was so anti-high-rise, I would bring the model over in sections,\\u201d Littenberg said. \\u201cIf Margot came by and saw it she'd say, 'Nope, that's too tall. That has got to go.' She would take the tops off of my towers.\\u201d</p><p>The plan would go on to win an American Institute of Architects Award, but at the city level, it wasn't an easy sell. The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development dismissed the community plan as impractical. In 1984, the same year the Clinton tenants came out with their plan, the department tried to raise their rents dramatically\\u2014by <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/18/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-241725.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">as much as 2,000 percent</a>.</p><p>\\u201cIt was a recognition by the city that they had for 20 years kept up the fiction they were going to redevelop the property,\\u201d said Shuldiner, the '80s-era deputy HPD commissioner who broke the news of the proposed increases. When the tenants balked, Shuldiner and his colleagues negotiated a settlement that was meant to more fairly compensate the city for managing the thousands of buildings it was the reluctant landlord of, without driving the tenants out.  </p><p>\\u201cMr.  Koch was famous for saying, 'No free lunch,'\\u201d Shuldiner said. \\u201cSome people within HPD thought we were giving free lunch.\\u201d </p><p>Nevertheless, Koch signed off on the settlement. By <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/arts/arts-groups-oppose-plan-for-clinton.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">1985</a>, WIC was paying $1,300 a month for four and a half floors. Geist estimates they had put $100,000 into the space by that point. Lewitin was also several years into a pitch to the city to buy the building for $400,000, and though the housing commissioner at the time reportedly expressed interest, the agency got cold feet over a philosophical difference: HPD, the housing agency, is focused on housing, rather than neighborhoods in all their complexity.</p><p>''I don't think we're ready to do it with them,'' assistant HPD Commissioner Charles Perkins <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/arts/arts-groups-oppose-plan-for-clinton.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">told the Times in 1985</a>.

In 1994, faced with what to gadflies was the disaster of the city suddenly moving 60 sanitation trucks to Hell's Kitchen, the local community board <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chelsea-clinton-a-tradeoff-trucks-for-housing.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">reached a deal with the city</a>: the neighborhood would temporarily house the trucks, which no other neighborhood wanted, in exchange for renovating six buildings in the urban renewal area and expediting WIC's ongoing quest to purchase its building, among other items.</p><p>Momentum was in the Clinton residents' favor that year. With Rudolph Giuliani in the mayor's office, a version of the community plan passed the final hurdle of the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, the same process that felled Koch's luxury tower plan a decade earlier. The approval covered WIC's proposed expansion, and an amendment to the urban renewal area allowed for the sale of 549 and the neighboring lots.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-right\\\"><img alt=\\\"160920CybertTire.jpeg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160920CybertTire.jpeg\\\" width=\\\"360\\\" height=\\\"640\\\"><br><i style=\\\" width:360px; ;display:block\\\">The century-old tire shop Cybert Tire is getting a dedicated space in a massive new mixed-income development being built by Clinton Housing Development Company and for-profit developers Taconic Investment Partners and Ritterman Capital.

On the surface, there is little obvious conflict between the visions of the two. Both want the urban renewal area to be a place for affordable housing, and to protect the arts organizations, longtime businesses and residents, and, where feasible, buildings. And yet, they have fought like crazy.</p><p>In Lewitin's telling, the years since 1994 have been an exercise in cynical collusion between various city agencies, local affordable housing developer <a href=\\\"http://clintonhousing.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Clinton Housing Development Company</a>, and those in the neighborhood willing to go along with the official program, even though it ran counter to the goals of the community plan of that era. </p><p>Restuccia's group, meanwhile, has had a remarkable run, using government and investor money, and occasionally partnering with outside real estate firms to develop hundreds of units of low and moderate-income housing, and supportive housing for formerly homeless people in four developments. Other developers, too, have channeled government grants and private investment to, with the blessing of many in the urban renewal area but not an increasingly estranged Lewitin and Geist, senior and other low-income housing. </p><p>The flood of construction ended a quiet five years after the community plan became the law of the land. </p><p>After the victories of 1994, Restuccia said, \\\"The community sat and could not get it together. They had developed a really good and creative plan for how to solve the problem. As for executing, they couldn\\u2019t do it.\\\" In 1999, many neighborhood stakeholders convened once more and agreed to, as Restuccia explains it, \\\"take the concepts of the mega-plan and now make them into small, doable sections.\\\" The problem of the 1994 plan was, he said, that all of the financing, all of the functions, \\\"Everything tied into the entire thing.\\\" </p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160920ClintonHousingUrbanRenewal.jpeg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160920ClintonHousingUrbanRenewal.jpeg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"480\\\"><br><i> The building housing the Women's Interart Center, in blue, is the last undeveloped lot on that half of the block, surrounded by new projects that all include some portion of below-market housing.

In a 27-story high-rise like the Avalon Clinton on WIC's block, 10s of thousands of square feet are set aside for nonprofit theater groups. Lewitin, though, is fixated on the 80 percent market-rate, 20 percent-below-market split in the building's apartments, a hallmark of the city's broader developer-driven approach to affordable housing.</p><p>\\\"The Community Plan demonstrated how to redevelop WITHOUT gentrification, creating affordable apartments in a truly mixed-use community, with open spaces, gardens and cultural vibrancy,\\u201d Lewitin wrote in a wistful email early this year.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160919DoctoroffBloomberg.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919DoctoroffBloomberg.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"465\\\"><br><i> Dan Doctoroff, left, was Mayor Michael Bloomberg's deputy mayor for development.

She also made a lot of enemies in the process, so it doesn\\u2019t surprise me that they wouldn\\u2019t accommodate her. It\\u2019s sad.\\u201d</p><p>Lewitin regrets some of her past bluster, saying she reads old news stories and finds her comments \\u201canything but prudent. At one point I described HPD as a criminal enterprise.\\u201d</p><p>On the most local level, WIC spent two decades trying to buy its building, and almost succeeded. The plan for a purchase and expansion was approved. In theory, all that the center had to do was come up with the money to finance the purchase and construction.</p><p>According to Lewitin, the first round of pledged state funding fell through when Governor George Pataki took office in 1995 and ordered a stop on development spending for projects that hadn't broken ground. Starting in 1988, WIC withheld rent on and off, complaining about unfixed leaks, broken boilers and radiators, and broken windows. Both sides took each other to court, and they repeatedly settled. Public criticisms of the direction the community plan was heading in did not help assuage the bad blood.</p><p>Proposed temporary relocation arrangements for their arts neighbors in the building didn't go over well, according to court filings, with the Ensemble Studio Theater proving particularly resistant to a temporary eviction for WIC's ends, and HPD refusing to formally evict them. The theater, which briefly tried to sue WIC and the city in the early 2000s, declined to comment. The EDC by all reports remained on board with the WIC plan through 2001.</p><p>Lewitin says her team again had funding lined up, this time in the form of $14 million in HUD loans and a $2 million grant from the city's Economic Development Corporation. A contract executed in August 2001 memorialized the plan for WIC to buy the building, for $2. The closing, Lewitin said, was delayed by the September 11th attacks, and according to court filings, by WIC continuing to line up funding. Lewitin claims that the incoming Bloomberg administration's general antipathy to community-based development, and WIC's opposition to a proposed <a href=\\\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/urbandev/features/9307/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">West Side stadium and Olympic complex</a> in particular soured Bloomberg's economic development czar Dan Doctoroff on the deal. An HPD spokeswoman said that WIC didn't have the additional $5 million it needed to put up to do the deal, but a federal judge's exhaustive timeline of the negotiations does not mention this. </p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160919WICBlueprint.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919WICBlueprint.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"426\\\"><br><i> Architectural drawings show WIC's planned expansion.

WIC sued in federal court for breach of contract. </p><p> In subsequent litigation, the EDC and HPD cited WIC's history of rent nonpayment as evidence that the center could not be trusted to fund the project on a federal grant alone, predicting the city would eventually have to cover the costs.</p><p>A March 2002 memo from EDC advisor Laurel Blatchford and deputy Roy Bahat to Deputy Mayor Doctoroff seems to undercut that claim. It reads:</p><blockquote><p>As per our discussion last week about Women\\u2019s Interart Center:\\n\\n</p><p>While the current financing structure does entail some risk to the city should WIC<br>\\ndefault on the $16M in CDBG loans, the financing package that WIC has<br>\\nassembled meets the city\\u2019s criteria.

CHDC did not respond to comment requests made by email and a message left with a receptionist.</p><p>After WIC lost in federal court, HPD brought in Restuccia's CHDC, to manage the building in 2007, and he brought eviction proceedings against them.  WIC renewed the fight in civil court, adding Clinton Housing to the docket.</p><p>As the litigation got going, the building's problems, always an issue, were becoming dramatically more pronounced. Already, in 1996, the passenger elevator had broken on the opening night of one of Lewitin's plays in 549, forcing the center to hire elevator operators for the run. On the final night, she said, the freight elevator broke too, stranding lights and other borrowed heavy equipment on the 10th floor.  </p><p>\\u201cI said, 'We're never doing another play on this floor until we own the building and have gutted it and renovated it,'\\u201d Lewitin recalled. They moved their plays to an auxiliary space in another building at the corner of 10th Avenue.</p><p>The collapse of the deal continued the drumbeat of misfortune and conflict with the city and Clinton Housing, which WIC has now for all practical purposes lost. </p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160919WICSlides.jpeg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919WICSlides.jpeg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"450\\\"><br><i> Slides from the WIC archives, for which the center's leaders are now seeking a home. (Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>In 2002, a water tower on the roof burst, sending water pouring through the skylight and any other permeable roof seam onto the 10th floor, and cascading down the stairs to the ninth, according to Geist. Whatever hope there had been of restoring the 10th floor theater was dashed long-term, and the gallery was destroyed. The space remains partially gutted and smells of decay. The water tower collapsed again in 2003, according to Geist. </p><p>The only remaining fully usable floor was the seventh, according to WIC. Based on what they considered a denial of services, they again withheld rent. Lacking a theater, Lewitin says they took apart their shop and renovated the space to see if they could supplement their income, primarily from grants, by renting office space short-term to film companies shooting in New York. (HPD and Restuccia say WIC was using these and other subletters to simply pad their pockets while withholding the nominal rent. The subletting violated WIC's lease, according to a federal judge's decision. Lewitin maintains that the TV business was a test-run to see if it could help support the complex she still dreamed of.) Then, in October of 2010, she says \\u201cCHDC pulled all of our elevators out and that was that.\\u201d </p><p>She says the group, acting as a property manager for HPD, closed the passenger elevator instead of repairing it, then reduced the freight elevator, which requires a certified operator, to 40 hours a week, charging tenants $15 an hour for usage outside of those hours, making the TV industry side business impossible.</p><p>HPD filed to evict WIC from the corner outpost where its resident theater troupe Blessed Unrest was staging productions. That eviction went through first, this past winter, ending WIC's public-facing events.</p><p>\\u201cI got quite an education in our legal system,\\u201d Geist told me as we toured what was left of the arts center in June. \\u201cNot that I wanted one, but I got one.\\u201d</p><p>The litigation held up a <a href=\\\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb4/downloads/pdf/Resolutions/JANUARY%202011/3%20CHKLU%20Letter%20to%20HPD%20re%20Clinton%20Commons.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">project called Clinton Commons</a>, a proposed 103-unit below-market condo development reserved for households making $38,016 to $130,680. The project was supposed to occupy the vacant lots Lewitin had her eye on for expansion, and the lawsuits put a cloud on the title.</p><p>Lewitin no longer gets out as much, but she's defiant and eternally optimistic about the next legal move, no matter how often her lawyers tell her they don't have a chance. Hence, after agreeing this March to an eviction settlement that gave them six months, or until August 31st to move out, WIC didn't leave without a fight. With that battle lost, the center has returned to yet another appeal. </p><p>Reached on the day of the eviction, Restuccia was reflective. \\\"I just feel bad for them,\\\" he said of Geist and Lewitin. Restuccia said that his goal was not to drive them out but to get them to negotiate some more modest vision for the building's future, to be shared with the other arts institutions downstairs. He added that he studied theater as a young man and knew of and admired the work of Women's Interart. The '90s marked a turning point for the center's output and its leaders' sense of their place in the community, he said.</p><p>\\\"When they got involved in this whole thing with making this building an arts center they lost their way,\\\" he said. \\\"They just lost perspective on this project.\\\"</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160919WICModel.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919WICModel.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"426\\\"><br><i> A waterlogged model of WIC's proposed expansion. (Nathan Tempey/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p>At some moments, even Lewitin, ever the fighter, can't help but feel frustrated by all that's happened.</p><p>\\u201cI hate to acknowledge it, but I\\u2019m getting really old,\\u201d Lewitin said. \\u201cI was trying to get this damn thing up and built so I could turn it over to the next generation of leadership.\\u201d</p><p>CHDC has told the remaining arts tenants that there will be a home for them in whatever comes next. The sad irony, Restuccia said, is that the project he and others have in mind\\u2014an all-arts and cultural complex with added rehearsal space\\u2014is \\\"in essence the vision that [WIC] had in a more reduced, modest version.\\\" He has no doubt the project will happen.</p><p>As I toured what was left of the space with Geist in June, the knicknacks hanging on the unfinished wall, the odor of wet wood, and the undone dishes around the ninth floor sink struck me as something that would be familiar to anyone who has spent time in a squat, or a collective art space in a formerly industrial building. Such spaces, for those without industrial tools of construction and access to the great fortunes they take to operate, are stubbornly temporary, their entropy constantly accelerating. This only becomes more apparent as time passes. The roofs leak. The walls and appliances drop soot on your precious belongings. Once-crisp boards sag beneath your feet.</p><p>In the painting studio, one last lively corner of the ninth floor along with the ceramics studio opposite, abstract painter Martin Mullin was at work, placing a layer of seal over freshly cracked gold leaf on a large canvas. Mullin modeled the red construction earmuffs he wears to block out the sound of construction on the surrounding lots of a two-building, block-through, Clinton Housing and Taconic Investment project containing 595 apartments, 414 of them market rate. \\u201cIt's great,\\u201d Mullin said, voice rising as he donned the muffs. \\u201cYou can't even hear your own body!\\u201d</p><p>I took a photo, then followed Geist into a nearby open area. Beyond stacks of film reels, sitting on a moving box, was a cardboard mockup of WIC's planned expansion. </p><p>\\u201cIt's so water-damaged,\\u201d Geist said. \\u201cYou shouldn't take a photo of it.\\u201d </p><p>\\u201cIsn't that kind of apt?\\u201d I asked.</p><p>\\u201cBe careful now,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou don't want to say anything that'd make me cry.\\u201d</p>\", \"text_more\": null, \"thumbnail_105\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/09/160919ClintonMasterPlanBeforeAfter-thumb-105x105-966238.jpg\", \"thumbnail_300\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/09/160919ClintonMasterPlanBeforeAfter-thumb-300x300-966238.jpg\", \"thumbnail_60\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/09/160919ClintonMasterPlanBeforeAfter-thumb-60x60-966238.jpg\", \"thumbnail_640\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/09/160919ClintonMasterPlanBeforeAfter-thumb-640xauto-966238.jpg\", \"title\": \"Urban Removal: How A Utopian Vision For Hell's Kitchen Burned Out\", \"leadImage\": {\"src\": \"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160919WICFlyerHappening.jpg\", \"caption\": \"A 1973 poster advertising the Women's Interart Center's offerings.\", \"credit\": \"<a href=\\\"http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=8&amp;psid=2851&amp;filepath=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/primarysources_upload/images/women_are_happening_l.jpg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Library of Congress</a>\", \"alt\": \"A 1973 poster advertising the Women's Interart Center's offerings.\"}}",

Let me thank all of you for welcoming an outsider here to deliver what will be an unconventional convention speech.</p><p></p><p>Now, I'm not here as a member of any party, or to endorse any party platform. I am here for one reason, and one reason only: to explain why I believe it is my imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States. And to ask you to join with me in supporting her this November.</p><p>When the Founding Fathers arrived here in Philadelphia to forge a new nation, they didn't come as Democrats or Republicans, or to nominate a presidential candidate. They came as patriots who feared party politics. I know how they felt. I've been a Democrat, I've been a Republican, and I eventually became an independent because I don't believe either party has a monopoly on good ideas or strong leadership.</p><p>When I enter the voting booth each time, I look at the candidate, not the party label. I have supported elected officials from both sides of the aisle. Probably not many people in this room can say that, but I know there are many watching at home who can. And now, they are carefully weighing their choices. I understand their dilemma.</p><p>I know what it's like to have neither party fully represent my views or values. Too many Republicans wrongly blame immigrants for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on climate change and gun violence. Meanwhile, many Democrats wrongly blame the private sector for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on education reform and deficit reduction.</p><p>There are times when I disagree with Hillary. But whatever our disagreements may be, I've come here to say: We must put them aside for the good of our country. And we must united around the candidate who can defeat a dangerous demagogue.</p><p>I believe it's the duty of all American citizens to make our voices heard by voting in this election. And, if you're not yet registered to vote, go online. Do it now. It's just too important to sit this out.</p><p>Now, we've heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business. I couldn't agree more. I've built a business and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father. Because of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run America's largest city for 12 years, governing in the wake of its greatest tragedy.</p><p>Today, as an independent, an entrepreneur, and a former mayor, I believe we need a president who is a problem solver, not a bomb thrower. Someone who can bring members of Congress together, to get things done. And I know Hillary Clinton can do that because I saw it firsthand.</p><p>I was elected mayor two months after 9/11, as a Republican — and I saw how Hillary Clinton worked with Republicans in Washington to ensure that New York got the help it needed to recover and rebuild. Throughout her time in the Senate, we didn't always agree<br>\n— but she always listened. And that's the kind of approach we need in Washington today, and it just has to start in the White House.</p><p>Given my background, I've often encouraged business leaders to run for office because many of them share that same pragmatic approach to building consensus, but not all. Most of us who have created a business know that we're only as good as the way our employees, clients, and partners view us. Most of us don't pretend that we're smart enough to make every big decision by ourselves. And most of us who have our names on the door know that we're only as good as our word. But not Donald Trump.</p><p>Throughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders, and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business. God help us.</p><p>I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! Trump says he'll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories. He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the US visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them. What'd I miss here?!</p><p>Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy. He wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He's wrong on both counts.</p><p>We can only solve our biggest problems if we come together and embrace the freedoms that our Founding Fathers established right here in Philadelphia, which permitted our ancestors to create the great American exceptionalism that all of us now enjoy. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. Hillary Clinton does. And we can only create good jobs if we make smarter investments in infrastructure and do more to support small businesses. Not stiff them. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. Hillary Clinton does.</p><p>I understand the appeal of a businessman president. But Trump's business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe.</p><p>The bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we can't afford to make that choice.</p><p>Now, I know Hillary Clinton is not flawless; no candidate is. But she is the right choice — and the responsible choice — in this election. No matter what you may think about her politics or her record, Hillary Clinton understands that this is not reality television; this is reality. She understands the job of president. It involves finding solutions, not pointing fingers, and offering hope, not stoking fear.</p><p>Over the course of our country's proud history, we have faced our share of grave challenges, but we have never retreated in fear. Never. Not here in Philadelphia in 1996, not at Gettysburg in 1863, not through two World Wars and a Great Depression, not at Selma or Stonewall, and not after 9/11 — and we must not start now.</p><p>America is the greatest country on Earth — and when people vote with their feet, they come here. The presidency of the United States is the most powerful office in the world, and so I say to my fellow independents: Your vote matters now. Your vote will determine the future of your job, your business, and our future together as a country.</p><p>To me, this election is not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. It's a choice about who is better to lead our country right now: better for our economy, better for our security, better for our freedom, and better for our future.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the right choice this November. So tonight, as an independent, I am asking you to join with me — not out of party loyalty but out of love of country. And together, let's elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America.</p><p>Thank you.</p></blockquote><p></p><center><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bloomberg, of all people, brought a a gun to a knife fight!</p><p>— Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RalstonReports/status/758477481670156288\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">July 28, 2016</a></p></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>"

I've built a business and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father. Because of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run America's largest city for 12 years, governing in the wake of its greatest tragedy.</p><p>Today, as an independent, an entrepreneur, and a former mayor, I believe we need a president who is a problem solver, not a bomb thrower. Someone who can bring members of Congress together, to get things done. And I know Hillary Clinton can do that because I saw it firsthand.</p><p>I was elected mayor two months after 9/11, as a Republican \\u2014 and I saw how Hillary Clinton worked with Republicans in Washington to ensure that New York got the help it needed to recover and rebuild. Throughout her time in the Senate, we didn't always agree<br>\\n\\u2014 but she always listened. And that's the kind of approach we need in Washington today, and it just has to start in the White House.</p><p>Given my background, I've often encouraged business leaders to run for office because many of them share that same pragmatic approach to building consensus, but not all. Most of us who have created a business know that we're only as good as the way our employees, clients, and partners view us. Most of us don't pretend that we're smart enough to make every big decision by ourselves. And most of us who have our names on the door know that we're only as good as our word. But not Donald Trump.</p><p>Throughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders, and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business. God help us.</p><p>I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! Trump says he'll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories. He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the US visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them. What'd I miss here?!</p><p>Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy. He wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He's wrong on both counts.</p><p>We can only solve our biggest problems if we come together and embrace the freedoms that our Founding Fathers established right here in Philadelphia, which permitted our ancestors to create the great American exceptionalism that all of us now enjoy. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. Hillary Clinton does. And we can only create good jobs if we make smarter investments in infrastructure and do more to support small businesses. Not stiff them. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. Hillary Clinton does.</p><p>I understand the appeal of a businessman president. But Trump's business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe.</p><p>The bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we can't afford to make that choice.</p><p>Now, I know Hillary Clinton is not flawless; no candidate is. But she is the right choice \\u2014 and the responsible choice \\u2014 in this election. No matter what you may think about her politics or her record, Hillary Clinton understands that this is not reality television; this is reality. She understands the job of president. It involves finding solutions, not pointing fingers, and offering hope, not stoking fear.</p><p>Over the course of our country's proud history, we have faced our share of grave challenges, but we have never retreated in fear. Never. Not here in Philadelphia in 1996, not at Gettysburg in 1863, not through two World Wars and a Great Depression, not at Selma or Stonewall, and not after 9/11 \\u2014 and we must not start now.</p><p>America is the greatest country on Earth \\u2014 and when people vote with their feet, they come here. The presidency of the United States is the most powerful office in the world, and so I say to my fellow independents: Your vote matters now. Your vote will determine the future of your job, your business, and our future together as a country.</p><p>To me, this election is not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. It's a choice about who is better to lead our country right now: better for our economy, better for our security, better for our freedom, and better for our future.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the right choice this November. So tonight, as an independent, I am asking you to join with me \\u2014 not out of party loyalty but out of love of country. And together, let's elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America.</p><p>Thank you.</p></blockquote><p></p><center><blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Bloomberg, of all people, brought a a gun to a knife fight!</p><p>\\u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/RalstonReports/status/758477481670156288\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">July 28, 2016</a></p></blockquote><script async=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script></center>\", \"text_more\": null, \"thumbnail_105\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/07/2016_07_bloombergdnc-thumb-105x105-959039.jpg\", \"thumbnail_300\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/07/2016_07_bloombergdnc-thumb-300x300-959039.jpg\", \"thumbnail_60\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/07/2016_07_bloombergdnc-thumb-60x60-959039.jpg\", \"thumbnail_640\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2016/07/2016_07_bloombergdnc-thumb-640xauto-959039.jpg\", \"title\": \"Bloomberg Attacks Trump: We Must Unite To Stop A 'Dangerous Demagogue'\", \"leadImage\": {\"src\": \"https://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_07_bloombergdnc.jpg\", \"caption\": \"This billionaire wants you to know that Donald Trump is a cruel, doofus billionaire\", \"credit\": \"Getty Images\", \"alt\": \"This billionaire wants you to know that Donald Trump is a cruel, doofus billionaire\"}}",

But unlike, for instance, the former mayor's disastrous choice of education chancellor, <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/tags/cathieblack\">Cathie Black</a>, whose only education experience was teaching sales reps to sling display ads as a magazine executive, Sadik-Khan knew what she was doing.</p><p>She had spent decades working in the city and federal transportation departments and at an engineering firms. Her Department of Transportation also ran differently from Bloomberg's Education Department, which embraced charter schools and closed struggling district schools rather than committing resources to rehabbing them, and failed to plan for the massive residential growth brought on by Bloomberg's rezoning in areas such as <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/brooklyn_school_integration.php\">DUMBO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/36/46/dtg_downtownelementary_2013_10_04_bk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Downtown Brooklyn</a>. Conversely, Sadik-Khan poured money into repaving highways and overhauling bridges—projects that took up <a href=\"http://observer.com/2011/09/road-warrior-janette-sadik-khan-is-the-best-mechanic-the-city-streets-have-had-in-a-generation-so-why-do-motorists-dislike-her-so-much/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the vast majority</a> of the Transportation Department capital budget—simultaneous to initiating the street-redesign spree that garnered nearly all the headlines.</p><p>Sadik-Khan is still firmly ensconced in Bloomberg's remaking-the-world-in-his-image machine, now as a transportation consultant to municipalities worldwide at the firm Bloomberg Associates. With her new book <em>Street Fight</em>, co-authored by former DOT spokesman Seth Solomonow, she reflects on her eventful six years in office, and how the city has moved on from a vocal bike backlash. At the height of the reaction, then-Public Advocate Bill de Blasio <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2012/08/19/de-blasios-bike-warpath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called himself an \"incrementalist\"</a> on road safety. Now the main transportation goal of de Blasio's City Hall is <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/visionzero\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reducing traffic deaths to zero</a> by 2024. Sadik-Khan gives the city's massive infrastructure needs a token chapter in her book, but even as she complains that the press focused too much on conflict over her road-safety-oriented overhauls, she spends most of the page-count discussing exactly that.</p><p>The book is defensive amid the celebration of the former commissioner's radical program. She relives each of the major battles over redesigns, recounting community board meetings, scathing editorials, and a Council hearing on bike lanes that was \"a cross-examination,\" while taking care to inform us that the traffic data prove she was right. </p><p>Today, the NIMBY element hasn't faded entirely: the <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/03/06/how-janette-sadik-khan-ruined-our-streets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York Post's Steve Cuozzo</a> is still out there bemoaning the \"suburban\" nature of plazas, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fundamentally urban</a> creation, and \"confusing bike lanes.\" But after years of living with the former commissioner's hundreds of miles of new bike lanes, seven new bus-rapid transit lines, and acres of pedestrian space reclaimed from drivers, New Yorkers are affirming her notion that a redesigned street is its own best proof of concept. The rate of warm-weather bike ridership <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bikestats.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doubled under Sadik-Khan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.streetsblog.org/2013/08/16/times-poll-new-yorkers-really-love-bike-lanes-bike-share-and-plazas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">polls show</a> around two thirds of New Yorkers support street-safety infrastructure, and the city just had another <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/vision_zero_2015_de_blasio.php\">safest year on record</a> in terms of traffic fatalities.</p><p>We chatted with Sadik-Khan in advance of the book's release about what she learned having a New York Post reporter for a mom, why people should care about infrastructure, and the ghost of the Bedford Avenue bike lane.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160307WebsterAveBeforeAfter.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160307WebsterAveBeforeAfter.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\"><br><i> The Bronx's Webster Avenue was one of five bus rapid transit routes created by Sadik-Khan's DOT in partnership with the MTA, providing dedicated on-street lanes and on-street payment to speed bus travel times. (Taylor Reiss Gouge/DOT)</i></div><p></p><p><strong>How is working in the private sector—how does it compare to the very eventful time that the book covers?</strong> Well my career has been about 50-50 in the public and private sector, and I think that that background was actually very, very helpful in working through the changes that we made in the New York City DOT. The public jobs are obviously public, and private jobs are private, and so there is a different level of scrutiny when you are in front of 8.4 million New Yorkers and changing the streets that they feel passionate about every day. </p><p><strong>How does working for Michael Bloomberg specifically compare between the public and the private sector?</strong> Well, Michael Bloomberg thrives on a private-sector metabolism and he is motivated by public-sector passions, and to make the world a better place, and to improve people's lives every day. So it's actually the perfect marriage of somebody that understands the private sector approach to getting things done, and having that married to an understanding of how change can happen in a city and what it takes to get that done. I think he's a very unusual mayor that way, and frankly we would not have gotten the change done on the streets of New York that we did without the vision and courage and political leadership of Michael Bloomberg.</p><p><strong>You mentioned in the book that your mom covered City Hall for the New York Post. Could you talk a little bit about when that was and what it was like having a mother in that line of work?</strong> Well the New York Post under <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/31/obituaries/dorothy-schiff-86-ex-post-owner-dies.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dorothy Schiff</a> was very different from the New York Post under Rupert Murdoch, there's no question about that. She covered Ed Koch for the New York Post. She actually started doing real estate and then moved into covering City Hall. </p><p>She's always been interested in stories and had a deep love of the city, and I think both of those, she passed both of those onto me. When we would walk around the city, which we did all the time, she would constantly tell me to look up and pay attention and watch what was going on. She was very much into the quote-unquote <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=P_bPTgOoBYkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=death+and+life+of+great+american+cities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixy6_Xvq7LAhWFLB4KHa7zAPgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ballet&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ballet of the streets</a>. And I learned a lot from walking around town with her.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160307LABroadwayBeforeAfter.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160307LABroadwayBeforeAfter.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"><br><i> Sadik-Khan is now consulting for poser cities such as Los Angeles, teaching them New York's famed bike-and-pedestrian-friendly ways. (Melani Smith-Meléndrez)</i></div><p></p><p><strong>What did you learn from your mom as far as how the press works that influenced how you dealt with the press in your role as transportation commissioner? Were there any tricks that came in handy? Or things that you understood that other people didn't?</strong> Well, no I don't think there are tricks. I just think that it sort of demystified the process, and I understood it better having watched her as a reporter. I definitely learned that the press aren't your friends. That certainly was a piece that came through.</p><p><strong>The press is a persistent theme in the book as far as giving a microphone to the bike backlash and possibly generating some controversy where there wouldn't have been as much otherwise. Do you think that you were treated unfairly during your time as transportation commissioner?</strong> No. I think that people take their streets personally. And they treat every parking space like it's their firstborn child. </p><p>I get it. When you talk about new ways to get around that aren't about driving, a lot of people really erupt. There are 8.4 million people in New York and sometimes I felt like there were 8.4 million traffic engineers. But you know, change is difficult, and people have a lot invested in the status quo. </p><p>The fact that people are so passionate about their streets is just evidence of how important they really are. I think that the notion of backlash is actually a sign that you're doing something right. When it comes to our streets, people that just maintain the status quo and install signs and signals, and fill potholes and paves, they have jobs for life, even if there is no change in congestion, and even if people continue to die on those streets. But those who try to change those streets are the ones taking a risk, and backlash is just a part of the job.</p><p><strong>Is there advice that you have for reporters covering transportation issues? Are there things that you'd like to see explored more that were overlooked during your time?</strong> I don't know that I would frame it in terms of controversy. I think that's a lot of the least interesting things about these kinds of projects. But there are many issues that we really do need to confront. We need to figure out ways to finance our <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/mta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">major transit investments</a>, and our <a href=\"http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/11/dtg-bqe-is-falling-down-2016-03-11-bk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">road investments</a>, and our bridge investments. I mean, we really need to identify the funding sources to be able to get that done. </p><p>I think we really need to really focus on the future of this region, and that does mean investing in <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/25/new_l_train_tunnel_or_revolution.php\">rail</a> <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2015/09/15/hudson_rail_tunnel_obama.php\">tunnels</a> and that means expanding transportation options, and I think that's gonna be key. It's not as sexy as stories that pit personalities against one another. But I think that you have to give people choices, and I think everybody agrees that the status quo doesn't work. And we have to do something about it. That inevitably leads to changes on the street, and we shouldn't have act surprised when that finally happens.</p><p><strong>Throughout the book there's a persistent certainty in what you're saying—at one point you refer to critics of road safety projects as “Cassandras.” Were you concerned at all as you were writing that this tone and those kinds of word choices might alienate people who are not yet sold on the ideas that you're presenting?</strong> No, this was not exactly a march to victory, which is what you see in the book. There was a lot that happened on the road to a more sustainable street. I do think that what we're talking about is the written and unwritten rules on the road, and we tend to take our streets for granted, but the way they are designed tells people how to use them. And in the book one of the things we do is show step by step how to do it. </p><p>The fact that streets that are designed for cars and tell people to drive everywhere is bad for business. There are many city streets that are over-built for cars. There's virtually cities trapped between the lanes. Streets that are designed from the view of somebody walking or biking, whether you're 8 or 80, is the key to making these cities work. It's not a particular tone, it's just the fact that the status quo is the problem that we're trying to solve. And many of the solutions have been hidden in plain sight for a long time. </p><p><strong>I appreciate the framing that Jane Jacobs ideas are so omnipresent that they're employed by people fighting to preserve Robert Moses features of the street. One big political conversation that's happening right now is Mayor De Blasio's <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/affordablehousingplan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affordable housing plan</a>, which rests on density and transit-oriented development making the city a more habitable place. As somebody who's lived in the West Village, which Jacobs held as a paragon of neighborhood function, can you understand emotionally what people in the neighborhood might oppose about coming and knocking down 3-story buildings and building 50-story towers, for example?</strong> I think a lot of people use Jane Jacobs' logic or cite Jane Jacobs' projects and they say no to anything in the name of preservation. But cities change, people change, demand changes, demographics change, technology changes, and we have to change our streets too. They have to constantly evolve and we have to make more efficient use of our assets today, whether they're streets or they're buildings. And so, I think getting beyond “no to new ideas” is critical. You can't wait to make all these changes, for all his progress, Moses was remarkable in his vision on implementation, but that needs to be married with an urban vision<em> a la </em>Jane Jacobs, that leads to a more sustainable, liveable, affordable, economically competitive place to be.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"102011bench.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/102011bench.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\"><br><i> Street benches rolled out under Sadik-Khan were designed to make it hard to lie down. (DOT)</i></div><p></p><p><strong>In the book you say that “doing nothing is one of the animating forces of the city,” and also that public policy discussions need to include all communities, not just rich ones. One thing that occurred to me is that one of the biggest users of public space outside of lunch time and weekends are homeless people, and they're also a group of street users that tend to get business owners and home owners upset and calling for removing street plazas and benches and that sort of thing. I was wondering—you addressed this somewhat in the book in reference to Times Square—what role do you see for street design in managing behavior? Do you see dealing with quality of life issues as fully a social service-police issue, or what role do you think street designers have to play?</strong> Wow, that's like a book that you just—“How do you deal with the homeless, how do you deal with street design, how do you deal with...” </p><p>Um, the pieces need to fit together, because when you're dealing with public space, you're dealing with every public issue. You're dealing with homelessness, you're dealing with seating, you're dealing with crowding, you're dealing with danger, you're dealing with congestion, you're dealing with all of it. You can't look at them as silo-ed pieces. The public pieces need to fit together to make public spaces work. </p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160307PearlStreetBeforeAfter.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160307PearlStreetBeforeAfter.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"523\"><br><i> Pearl Street in DUMBO, Brooklyn, before and after the installation of a pedestrian plaza in 2007.

Do you see the need for the DOT to go back in and rethink those spaces, or what is the solution to those kinds of complaints?</strong> I think that having <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=P_bPTgOoBYkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=death+and+life+of+great+american+cities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixy6_Xvq7LAhWFLB4KHa7zAPgQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22eyes%20on%20the%20street%22&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eyes on the street</a> is the best cure. I have seen very little urinating going on in most plazas. I think there are solutions to Hello Kitty in Times Square soliciting tips, too. You don't need to rip out these spaces because there are issues that need to be dealt with. And I think that monitoring and working and the like are really easy ways to work on those issues and work with the communities that are highlighting where additional attention is needed. </p><p>I also think that you get a lot of buy-ins from small businesses when you take a look at the economics that happen with public spaces that we've created. You know the plaza in DUMBO, <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/evil_bike_lanes_pedestrian_plazas_h.php\">172 percent increase in retail sales</a> when it opened, you know the success story of Times Square, you know the success story of Union Square, we can go through all of them. The bottom line is that better spaces are better for business. Good streets are self-enforcing, and good neighbors make great streets.</p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"2015_09_desnudas123.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_09_desnudas123.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"516\"><br><i> The tabloid-driven outrage over topless panhandlers in Times Square's plaza reclaimed from cars prompted police Commissioner Bill Bratton to say he'd like to \"dig the damn thing up.\" (Jen Chung/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p><strong>Why do you think people are so emphatic about New York <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/bike-wars-2011-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not being Copenhagen</a>?</strong> [laughter] Well you know I think the funny thing that it's gotten to now is that people are saying “We're not New York.” When there are stories about transportation controversies in other cities today, people say, “We're not New York,” which is a victory. </p><p>A few years ago a lot of people said, “You can't do bike lanes or plazas in New York. We're not Amsterdam and we're not Copenhagen.” I think that highlights what a big sea change it's been and how far we've come. </p><p><strong>The book was the first acknowledgment I've seen from somebody in DOT that the Bedford Avenue bike lane was ripped out explicitly because of the concerns of leaders of the Hasidic community in Williamsburg. I was wondering, did the DOT intentionally leave the shoulder wide so that cyclists would continue to use the vestige of the lane?</strong> Well, you know, of course not. [hearty laughter]</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm not sure what to read into that laughter.</strong></p><p><strong>At that time Transportation Alternatives was sort of a counter-force criticizing you even though they backed you guys in many respects. On that issue, they were saying “There's no redundancy in networks in our view and the Bedford lane should stay.” Now a lot of those same people who were friends of yours in many cases are focusing their criticism on Polly Trottenberg, who they have obviously a lot in common with. One of the recurring criticisms that I've is that the DOT is too deferential to community boards, and that's at the cost of <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/lafayette_avenue_bike_lane.php\">creating gaps</a> <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2015/10/15/williamsburg_bike_lane_wars.php\">in the bike network</a> and not putting in slow zones in certain areas. Do you think that the DOT needs to be more forceful, or that there's a point at which the DOT should just treat all road redesigns in the same way that they treat stop signs, etc?</strong> Going back to the earlier point, I would say that you can't win every battle, but we certainly did the best we could with this situation. And I'm not going to get into criticizing DOT. I'm very close with Polly, so that's a nonstarter for me.</p><p><strong>One thing that stands out about Ms. Trottenberg's tenure so far is <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com/visionzero\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vision Zero</a>. You say that one of your goals was to get traffic deaths down to 135 by 2035, and the new goal is to get down to 0 by 2024. Do you see that as sort of more of an aspirational, almost religious kind of idea or do you think that 0 is achievable?</strong> I think it's really great to see mayors and political leaders strive for these goals. The fact that we have 33,000 deaths on streets in our country every year is, I think, almost criminal, the fact that we haven't done something about it. So everything that we can do to move the needle to address this is important, whether it is through extrication, design, enforcement, campaigns—we need to use every single tool in our toolbox to address this. And you're seeing leaders understand that if you use the data and identify dangerous spots in your city, those two pieces married together can go a long way to driving down the preventable injuries and fatalities on our streets. </p><p>So I'm very much in support of the work on Vision Zero and taking a data-driven approach to the streets of not only this city but cities across the U.S. and around the world. It's a matter of life and death and we can do something about it. </p><p><strong>I understand not wanting to answer a hypothetical. Is there an example of a place, a major city that has reached 0 traffic deaths?</strong> Not that I know of, but I think you see in the Netherlands there's a lot of really interesting design that's happening where they removed all of the street signs and stop signs from the city and basically used the design of the street itself to guide behavior. And I think you're gonna see people moving more towards that approach, again, changing our streets to support the life that is along the way and not working at all against it.</p><p><strong>Another one of your major achievements was bringing in Citi Bike, and I know that you explained the need to privately fund it because it would be a very difficult sell after the recession, to spend tens of millions of dollars on a bike share program. But in the long-term, you mentioned the problems with Alta and Citibank's commitment is only good for so long.  Do you see a way to move away from private funding and make it a fully public service?</strong> I think you can do it any number of ways. I just think that we thought this is a really good option because we've studied what had worked in London with Barclays, and we took that model and married it to some of the quick installation models that we saw in other cities, and made it work on the streets of New York. I think that other cities will make other decisions, it really depends on the mayor. And it really just depends on the financing. </p><p>I do think that there's an incredible opportunity to use sponsorship and that kind of access to be able to fund these new transportation systems around the country. I think you're gonna see that more and more with constrained municipal budgets. You're going to see mayors looking to install these new systems, not having to use their public funding to do it, but utilizing the private sector to be able to double down on that kind of investment. </p><p><span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"></span></p><div class=\"image-none\"><img alt=\"160307PPWBeforeAfter.jpg\" src=\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160307PPWBeforeAfter.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"><br><i> The Prospect Park West bike path is still the subject of <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/someday_this_wars_gonna_end.php\">a lawsuit</a>, but in terms of encouraging cycling and slowing speeding drivers, it's been a success.

With her new book <em>Street Fight</em>, co-authored by former DOT spokesman Seth Solomonow, she reflects on her eventful six years in office, and how the city has moved on from a vocal bike backlash. At the height of the reaction, then-Public Advocate Bill de Blasio <a href=\\\"http://nypost.com/2012/08/19/de-blasios-bike-warpath/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">called himself an \\\"incrementalist\\\"</a> on road safety.

Sadik-Khan gives the city's massive infrastructure needs a token chapter in her book, but even as she complains that the press focused too much on conflict over her road-safety-oriented overhauls, she spends most of the page-count discussing exactly that.</p><p>The book is defensive amid the celebration of the former commissioner's radical program. She relives each of the major battles over redesigns, recounting community board meetings, scathing editorials, and a Council hearing on bike lanes that was \\\"a cross-examination,\\\" while taking care to inform us that the traffic data prove she was right. </p><p>Today, the NIMBY element hasn't faded entirely: the <a href=\\\"http://nypost.com/2016/03/06/how-janette-sadik-khan-ruined-our-streets/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">New York Post's Steve Cuozzo</a> is still out there bemoaning the \\\"suburban\\\" nature of plazas, a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">fundamentally urban</a> creation, and \\\"confusing bike lanes.\\\" But after years of living with the former commissioner's hundreds of miles of new bike lanes, seven new bus-rapid transit lines, and acres of pedestrian space reclaimed from drivers, New Yorkers are affirming her notion that a redesigned street is its own best proof of concept.

The public jobs are obviously public, and private jobs are private, and so there is a different level of scrutiny when you are in front of 8.4 million New Yorkers and changing the streets that they feel passionate about every day. </p><p><strong>How does working for Michael Bloomberg specifically compare between the public and the private sector?</strong> Well, Michael Bloomberg thrives on a private-sector metabolism and he is motivated by public-sector passions, and to make the world a better place, and to improve people's lives every day. So it's actually the perfect marriage of somebody that understands the private sector approach to getting things done, and having that married to an understanding of how change can happen in a city and what it takes to get that done. I think he's a very unusual mayor that way, and frankly we would not have gotten the change done on the streets of New York that we did without the vision and courage and political leadership of Michael Bloomberg.</p><p><strong>You mentioned in the book that your mom covered City Hall for the New York Post. Could you talk a little bit about when that was and what it was like having a mother in that line of work?</strong> Well the New York Post under <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/31/obituaries/dorothy-schiff-86-ex-post-owner-dies.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Dorothy Schiff</a> was very different from the New York Post under Rupert Murdoch, there's no question about that. She covered Ed Koch for the New York Post. She actually started doing real estate and then moved into covering City Hall. </p><p>She's always been interested in stories and had a deep love of the city, and I think both of those, she passed both of those onto me. When we would walk around the city, which we did all the time, she would constantly tell me to look up and pay attention and watch what was going on. She was very much into the quote-unquote <a href=\\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=P_bPTgOoBYkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=death+and+life+of+great+american+cities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixy6_Xvq7LAhWFLB4KHa7zAPgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ballet&amp;f=false\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">ballet of the streets</a>.

(Melani Smith-Mel\\u00e9ndrez)</i></div><p></p><p><strong>What did you learn from your mom as far as how the press works that influenced how you dealt with the press in your role as transportation commissioner? Were there any tricks that came in handy? Or things that you understood that other people didn't?</strong> Well, no I don't think there are tricks. I just think that it sort of demystified the process, and I understood it better having watched her as a reporter. I definitely learned that the press aren't your friends. That certainly was a piece that came through.</p><p><strong>The press is a persistent theme in the book as far as giving a microphone to the bike backlash and possibly generating some controversy where there wouldn't have been as much otherwise. Do you think that you were treated unfairly during your time as transportation commissioner?</strong> No. I think that people take their streets personally. And they treat every parking space like it's their firstborn child. </p><p>I get it. When you talk about new ways to get around that aren't about driving, a lot of people really erupt. There are 8.4 million people in New York and sometimes I felt like there were 8.4 million traffic engineers. But you know, change is difficult, and people have a lot invested in the status quo. </p><p>The fact that people are so passionate about their streets is just evidence of how important they really are. I think that the notion of backlash is actually a sign that you're doing something right. When it comes to our streets, people that just maintain the status quo and install signs and signals, and fill potholes and paves, they have jobs for life, even if there is no change in congestion, and even if people continue to die on those streets. But those who try to change those streets are the ones taking a risk, and backlash is just a part of the job.</p><p><strong>Is there advice that you have for reporters covering transportation issues? Are there things that you'd like to see explored more that were overlooked during your time?</strong> I don't know that I would frame it in terms of controversy. I think that's a lot of the least interesting things about these kinds of projects. But there are many issues that we really do need to confront. We need to figure out ways to finance our <a href=\\\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/mta\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">major transit investments</a>, and our <a href=\\\"http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/39/11/dtg-bqe-is-falling-down-2016-03-11-bk.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">road investments</a>, and our bridge investments. I mean, we really need to identify the funding sources to be able to get that done. </p><p>I think we really need to really focus on the future of this region, and that does mean investing in <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/25/new_l_train_tunnel_or_revolution.php\\\">rail</a> <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2015/09/15/hudson_rail_tunnel_obama.php\\\">tunnels</a> and that means expanding transportation options, and I think that's gonna be key. It's not as sexy as stories that pit personalities against one another. But I think that you have to give people choices, and I think everybody agrees that the status quo doesn't work. And we have to do something about it. That inevitably leads to changes on the street, and we shouldn't have act surprised when that finally happens.</p><p><strong>Throughout the book there's a persistent certainty in what you're saying\\u2014at one point you refer to critics of road safety projects as \\u201cCassandras.\\u201d Were you concerned at all as you were writing that this tone and those kinds of word choices might alienate people who are not yet sold on the ideas that you're presenting?</strong> No, this was not exactly a march to victory, which is what you see in the book. There was a lot that happened on the road to a more sustainable street. I do think that what we're talking about is the written and unwritten rules on the road, and we tend to take our streets for granted, but the way they are designed tells people how to use them. And in the book one of the things we do is show step by step how to do it. </p><p>The fact that streets that are designed for cars and tell people to drive everywhere is bad for business. There are many city streets that are over-built for cars. There's virtually cities trapped between the lanes. Streets that are designed from the view of somebody walking or biking, whether you're 8 or 80, is the key to making these cities work. It's not a particular tone, it's just the fact that the status quo is the problem that we're trying to solve. And many of the solutions have been hidden in plain sight for a long time. </p><p><strong>I appreciate the framing that Jane Jacobs ideas are so omnipresent that they're employed by people fighting to preserve Robert Moses features of the street. One big political conversation that's happening right now is Mayor De Blasio's <a href=\\\"http://www.gothamist.com/tags/affordablehousingplan\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">affordable housing plan</a>, which rests on density and transit-oriented development making the city a more habitable place. As somebody who's lived in the West Village, which Jacobs held as a paragon of neighborhood function, can you understand emotionally what people in the neighborhood might oppose about coming and knocking down 3-story buildings and building 50-story towers, for example?</strong> I think a lot of people use Jane Jacobs' logic or cite Jane Jacobs' projects and they say no to anything in the name of preservation. But cities change, people change, demand changes, demographics change, technology changes, and we have to change our streets too. They have to constantly evolve and we have to make more efficient use of our assets today, whether they're streets or they're buildings. And so, I think getting beyond \\u201cno to new ideas\\u201d is critical. You can't wait to make all these changes, for all his progress, Moses was remarkable in his vision on implementation, but that needs to be married with an urban vision<em> a la </em>Jane Jacobs, that leads to a more sustainable, liveable, affordable, economically competitive place to be.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"102011bench.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/102011bench.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"427\\\"><br><i> Street benches rolled out under Sadik-Khan were designed to make it hard to lie down.

One thing that occurred to me is that one of the biggest users of public space outside of lunch time and weekends are homeless people, and they're also a group of street users that tend to get business owners and home owners upset and calling for removing street plazas and benches and that sort of thing. I was wondering\\u2014you addressed this somewhat in the book in reference to Times Square\\u2014what role do you see for street design in managing behavior? Do you see dealing with quality of life issues as fully a social service-police issue, or what role do you think street designers have to play?</strong> Wow, that's like a book that you just\\u2014\\u201cHow do you deal with the homeless, how do you deal with street design, how do you deal with...\\u201d </p><p>Um, the pieces need to fit together, because when you're dealing with public space, you're dealing with every public issue. You're dealing with homelessness, you're dealing with seating, you're dealing with crowding, you're dealing with danger, you're dealing with congestion, you're dealing with all of it. You can't look at them as silo-ed pieces.

Do you see the need for the DOT to go back in and rethink those spaces, or what is the solution to those kinds of complaints?</strong> I think that having <a href=\\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=P_bPTgOoBYkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=death+and+life+of+great+american+cities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixy6_Xvq7LAhWFLB4KHa7zAPgQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22eyes%20on%20the%20street%22&amp;f=false\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">eyes on the street</a> is the best cure. I have seen very little urinating going on in most plazas. I think there are solutions to Hello Kitty in Times Square soliciting tips, too. You don't need to rip out these spaces because there are issues that need to be dealt with. And I think that monitoring and working and the like are really easy ways to work on those issues and work with the communities that are highlighting where additional attention is needed. </p><p>I also think that you get a lot of buy-ins from small businesses when you take a look at the economics that happen with public spaces that we've created. You know the plaza in DUMBO, <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/evil_bike_lanes_pedestrian_plazas_h.php\\\">172 percent increase in retail sales</a> when it opened, you know the success story of Times Square, you know the success story of Union Square, we can go through all of them. The bottom line is that better spaces are better for business. Good streets are self-enforcing, and good neighbors make great streets.</p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"2015_09_desnudas123.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_09_desnudas123.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"516\\\"><br><i> The tabloid-driven outrage over topless panhandlers in Times Square's plaza reclaimed from cars prompted police Commissioner Bill Bratton to say he'd like to \\\"dig the damn thing up.\\\" (Jen Chung/Gothamist)</i></div><p></p><p><strong>Why do you think people are so emphatic about New York <a href=\\\"http://nymag.com/news/features/bike-wars-2011-3/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">not being Copenhagen</a>?</strong> [laughter] Well you know I think the funny thing that it's gotten to now is that people are saying \\u201cWe're not New York.\\u201d When there are stories about transportation controversies in other cities today, people say, \\u201cWe're not New York,\\u201d which is a victory. </p><p>A few years ago a lot of people said, \\u201cYou can't do bike lanes or plazas in New York. We're not Amsterdam and we're not Copenhagen.\\u201d I think that highlights what a big sea change it's been and how far we've come. </p><p><strong>The book was the first acknowledgment I've seen from somebody in DOT that the Bedford Avenue bike lane was ripped out explicitly because of the concerns of leaders of the Hasidic community in Williamsburg. I was wondering, did the DOT intentionally leave the shoulder wide so that cyclists would continue to use the vestige of the lane?</strong> Well, you know, of course not. [hearty laughter]</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm not sure what to read into that laughter.</strong></p><p><strong>At that time Transportation Alternatives was sort of a counter-force criticizing you even though they backed you guys in many respects. On that issue, they were saying \\u201cThere's no redundancy in networks in our view and the Bedford lane should stay.\\u201d Now a lot of those same people who were friends of yours in many cases are focusing their criticism on Polly Trottenberg, who they have obviously a lot in common with. One of the recurring criticisms that I've is that the DOT is too deferential to community boards, and that's at the cost of <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/lafayette_avenue_bike_lane.php\\\">creating gaps</a> <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2015/10/15/williamsburg_bike_lane_wars.php\\\">in the bike network</a> and not putting in slow zones in certain areas. Do you think that the DOT needs to be more forceful, or that there's a point at which the DOT should just treat all road redesigns in the same way that they treat stop signs, etc?</strong> Going back to the earlier point, I would say that you can't win every battle, but we certainly did the best we could with this situation. And I'm not going to get into criticizing DOT. I'm very close with Polly, so that's a nonstarter for me.</p><p><strong>One thing that stands out about Ms. Trottenberg's tenure so far is <a href=\\\"http://www.gothamist.com/visionzero\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Vision Zero</a>. You say that one of your goals was to get traffic deaths down to 135 by 2035, and the new goal is to get down to 0 by 2024. Do you see that as sort of more of an aspirational, almost religious kind of idea or do you think that 0 is achievable?</strong> I think it's really great to see mayors and political leaders strive for these goals. The fact that we have 33,000 deaths on streets in our country every year is, I think, almost criminal, the fact that we haven't done something about it. So everything that we can do to move the needle to address this is important, whether it is through extrication, design, enforcement, campaigns\\u2014we need to use every single tool in our toolbox to address this. And you're seeing leaders understand that if you use the data and identify dangerous spots in your city, those two pieces married together can go a long way to driving down the preventable injuries and fatalities on our streets. </p><p>So I'm very much in support of the work on Vision Zero and taking a data-driven approach to the streets of not only this city but cities across the U.S. and around the world. It's a matter of life and death and we can do something about it. </p><p><strong>I understand not wanting to answer a hypothetical. Is there an example of a place, a major city that has reached 0 traffic deaths?</strong> Not that I know of, but I think you see in the Netherlands there's a lot of really interesting design that's happening where they removed all of the street signs and stop signs from the city and basically used the design of the street itself to guide behavior. And I think you're gonna see people moving more towards that approach, again, changing our streets to support the life that is along the way and not working at all against it.</p><p><strong>Another one of your major achievements was bringing in Citi Bike, and I know that you explained the need to privately fund it because it would be a very difficult sell after the recession, to spend tens of millions of dollars on a bike share program. But in the long-term, you mentioned the problems with Alta and Citibank's commitment is only good for so long.  Do you see a way to move away from private funding and make it a fully public service?</strong> I think you can do it any number of ways. I just think that we thought this is a really good option because we've studied what had worked in London with Barclays, and we took that model and married it to some of the quick installation models that we saw in other cities, and made it work on the streets of New York. I think that other cities will make other decisions, it really depends on the mayor. And it really just depends on the financing. </p><p>I do think that there's an incredible opportunity to use sponsorship and that kind of access to be able to fund these new transportation systems around the country. I think you're gonna see that more and more with constrained municipal budgets. You're going to see mayors looking to install these new systems, not having to use their public funding to do it, but utilizing the private sector to be able to double down on that kind of investment. </p><p><span class=\\\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\"></span></p><div class=\\\"image-none\\\"><img alt=\\\"160307PPWBeforeAfter.jpg\\\" src=\\\"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ntempey/160307PPWBeforeAfter.jpg\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"360\\\"><br><i> The Prospect Park West bike path is still the subject of <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/someday_this_wars_gonna_end.php\\\">a lawsuit</a>, but in terms of encouraging cycling and slowing speeding drivers, it's been a success.

Do you have a dream job beyond this job?</strong> Well, I think this is a pretty dreamy job.

This means continuing to press for change in Washington and moving beyond Congress to bring the fight for common-sense gun policies to state capitols, corporate boards, and state and federal elections - fields of play formerly occupied almost solely by the gun lobby.  Supporters of Everytown will back candidates and legislation that will save lives, donate to the group\\u2019s efforts and take action to raise awareness for important issues like guns in schools, domestic violence, child access to guns, suicide and the other ways that gun violence affects all Americans.\\\"</p><p>Also, Bloomberg totally believes in Heaven because he's bought admission, \\\"I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I\\u2019m not stopping to be interviewed.

Instead, in the month since the <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/tags/newtown\">massacre at Sandy Hook</a> Bloomberg and his buddies in the growing <a href=\"http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/home/home.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mayors Against Illegal Guns</a> have been upping the pressure to <a href=\"http://www.demandaplan.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand a Plan</a> to end gun violence. And today Bloomberg—who is in Baltimore this morning delivering the opening address at the “Summit on Reducing Gun Violence in America\" at Johns Hopkins University—turned to the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/beat-nra-article-1.1238573?localLinksEnabled=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opinion pages of the Daily News</a> to push it a little further. </p><p>\"If we are serious about protecting lives, we have to get serious about enforcing our laws,\" he wrote in the op-ed. \"<strong>It’s not enough to punish crime; our goal should be to prevent it.</strong>\" Bloomberg, who also appeared on <em>Meet The Press</em> to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/bloomberg-split-nra-gop.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press his opinion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mayor-bloomberg-takes-on-the-gun-lobby/2013/01/13/5fd61888-5d9c-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talked up his plans to reform the GOP to the Washington Post</a> this weekend, went on to explain that one of the biggest issues with gun control is not gun owners, but the gun lobby (which he says isn't as strong as everyone says it is: \"Last November, I supported five candidates for Congress who were running against NRA-backed candidates. Four of them won, showing that <strong>the NRA’s power is more myth than reality.</strong>\"):</p><blockquote><p>This issue is not about whether we uphold the Constitution. It’s about whether members of Congress have the courage to buck a special interest group that is endangering our children — and all of America.<br>\nGun owners understand this. In fact, more than 80% of gun owners support common sense steps — like background checks for all gun sales — to strengthen our gun laws. They recognize that those laws protect them, too. Right now, any violent criminal can log onto the internet or go to a gun show and buy a gun illegally. Whether or not you are a gun owner, that reality threatens all of us.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>And that threat sadly is not going away the way we're going. To that end the mayor and his mayor friends are pushing Americans to sign their <a href=\"http://www.demandaplan.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand A Plan</a> petition which \"urges the President and Congress to require background checks for every gun sale, ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines and make gun trafficking a federal crime.\" Because, as he writes:</p><blockquote><p>But we cannot solve the problem of gun violence by ourselves. About 85% of all guns used in New York City crimes come from out of state, largely from states with very lax gun laws. This is a national problem that requires national leadership from our elected representatives in Washington. <strong>I have spoken with both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, and I am hopeful that they will take concrete action this week.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><p>Vice President Biden is scheduled to submit his recommendations to President Obama today, and Obama will give a press conference this morning at 11:15, during which the topic of gun control is all but certain to come up.<br></p>"

Four of them won, showing that <strong>the NRA\\u2019s power is more myth than reality.</strong>\\\"):</p><blockquote><p>This issue is not about whether we uphold the Constitution. It\\u2019s about whether members of Congress have the courage to buck a special interest group that is endangering our children \\u2014 and all of America.<br>\\nGun owners understand this. In fact, more than 80% of gun owners support common sense steps \\u2014 like background checks for all gun sales \\u2014 to strengthen our gun laws. They recognize that those laws protect them, too. Right now, any violent criminal can log onto the internet or go to a gun show and buy a gun illegally. Whether or not you are a gun owner, that reality threatens all of us.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>And that threat sadly is not going away the way we're going. To that end the mayor and his mayor friends are pushing Americans to sign their <a href=\\\"http://www.demandaplan.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Demand A Plan</a> petition which \\\"urges the President and Congress to require background checks for every gun sale, ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines and make gun trafficking a federal crime.\\\" Because, as he writes:</p><blockquote><p>But we cannot solve the problem of gun violence by ourselves. About 85% of all guns used in New York City crimes come from out of state, largely from states with very lax gun laws. This is a national problem that requires national leadership from our elected representatives in Washington. <strong>I have spoken with both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, and I am hopeful that they will take concrete action this week.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><p>Vice President Biden is scheduled to submit his recommendations to President Obama today, and Obama will give a press conference this morning at 11:15, during which the topic of gun control is all but certain to come up.<br></p>\", \"text_more\": null, \"thumbnail_105\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/01/201301_bloomeyebulge-thumb-105x105-767400.jpg\", \"thumbnail_300\": null, \"thumbnail_60\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/01/201301_bloomeyebulge-thumb-60x60-767400.jpg\", \"thumbnail_640\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2013/01/201301_bloomeyebulge-thumb-640xauto-767400.jpg\", \"title\": \"Bloomberg: \\\"The NRA's Power Is More Myth Than Reality\\\"\", \"leadImage\": {\"src\": \"https://gothamist.com/attachments/garth/201301_bloomeyebulge.jpg\", \"caption\": \"Bloomberg and New York's Semi-First Lady Sandra Lee at the State of the State Address last week\", \"credit\": \"<a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nycmayorsoffice/8365671308/in/photostream\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">nycmayorsoffice</a>'s flickr\", \"alt\": \"Bloomberg and New York's Semi-First Lady Sandra Lee at the State of the State Address last week\"}}",

Besides voicing his differences with Palin, the mayor also defended his adviser Andrea Batista Schlesinger's right to reply to Palin via Twitter. <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/07/mayor-bloomberg-on-aides-anti-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Daily News reports</a> that when asked if Schlesinger's tweet seemed to suggest Palin was being racist, Bloomberg replied:</p><p></p><blockquote><p>I thought she [Schlesinger] was more than 'seemed to,' as a matter of fact. You know, anybody that's read Andrea Batista Schlesinger's book 'The Death Of Why?' should know what her views are. I've always tried to have an administration with people from all the ends of the political spectrum and everything in the middle. I think it's fair to say that Andrea is sort of on the left side of that, and she has a right to her opinion, and I will defend her right to speak her mind. I want to pick people from every place and let them work together. In terms of her comments on Sarah Palin, I don't agree at all. But I certainly agree that freedom of speech is just as important as freedom of religion...\n\n</p><p>I think our young men and women overseas are fighting for exactly this, for the right to, of people to practice their religion and for government to not pick and choose which religions they support and which religions they don't. Sarah Palin has a right to her opinions, but I could not disagree more. Everything the United States stands for and New York stands for is tolerance and openness, and I think it's a great message for the world that unlike in other places where they might actually ban people from wearing a burqua or they might actually keep people from building a building, that's not what America was founded on, nor is it what America should become.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Bloomberg also gave a slightly confusing answer to a question about whether City Hall should have a social media policy for employees who use sites like Twitter. Perhaps mistaking Schlesinger's Twitter post for e-mail, <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/bloomberg_ipad.php\">the iPad lovin' mayor</a> replied, \"We have one. We have one. It's a personal email, and she has a right to her speech. I don't think I should tell people what they can believe, should believe, or what they can say. There are rules as to you must make sure that you identify that you're speaking for yourself and not for the government. <strong>But I can tell you, if we kept people from being able to speak their mind, I think we'd be hard-pressed to attract good people.\"</strong><a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2010/07/08/cnn_editor_fired_for_voicing_opinio.php\">Got that, CNN</a>?</p>"

You know, anybody that's read Andrea Batista Schlesinger's book 'The Death Of Why?' should know what her views are. I've always tried to have an administration with people from all the ends of the political spectrum and everything in the middle. I think it's fair to say that Andrea is sort of on the left side of that, and she has a right to her opinion, and I will defend her right to speak her mind. I want to pick people from every place and let them work together. In terms of her comments on Sarah Palin, I don't agree at all. But I certainly agree that freedom of speech is just as important as freedom of religion...\\n\\n</p><p>I think our young men and women overseas are fighting for exactly this, for the right to, of people to practice their religion and for government to not pick and choose which religions they support and which religions they don't. Sarah Palin has a right to her opinions, but I could not disagree more. Everything the United States stands for and New York stands for is tolerance and openness, and I think it's a great message for the world that unlike in other places where they might actually ban people from wearing a burqua or they might actually keep people from building a building, that's not what America was founded on, nor is it what America should become.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Bloomberg also gave a slightly confusing answer to a question about whether City Hall should have a social media policy for employees who use sites like Twitter. Perhaps mistaking Schlesinger's Twitter post for e-mail, <a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/bloomberg_ipad.php\\\">the iPad lovin' mayor</a> replied, \\\"We have one. We have one. It's a personal email, and she has a right to her speech. I don't think I should tell people what they can believe, should believe, or what they can say. There are rules as to you must make sure that you identify that you're speaking for yourself and not for the government. <strong>But I can tell you, if we kept people from being able to speak their mind, I think we'd be hard-pressed to attract good people.\\\"</strong><a href=\\\"http://gothamist.com/2010/07/08/cnn_editor_fired_for_voicing_opinio.php\\\">Got that, CNN</a>?</p>\", \"text_more\": null, \"thumbnail_105\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2010/07/071910bloomberg-thumb-105x105-529958.jpg\", \"thumbnail_300\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2010/07/071910bloomberg-thumb-300x300-529958.jpg\", \"thumbnail_60\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2010/07/071910bloomberg-thumb-60x60-529958.jpg\", \"thumbnail_640\": \"http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2010/07/071910bloomberg-thumb-640xauto-529958.jpg\", \"title\": \"Bloomberg Defends Aide's Freedom of Tweet\", \"leadImage\": {\"src\": \"https://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/071910bloomberg.jpg\", \"caption\": \"NYC <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nycmayorsoffice/page4/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Mayor's Office Flickr</a>\", \"credit\": \"\", \"alt\": \"NYC Mayor's Office Flickr\"}}",

                            "value": "<p>Nearly two years after Black Lives Matter protests swept through New York City, the city’s police watchdog agency released new figures on its investigations into civilian complaints made against officers for alleged misconduct during the demonstrations, showing that very few charged with serious allegations faced any discipline.</p><p>The Civilian Complaint Review Board said this week it has confirmed 187 allegations of misconduct against 104 members of the NYPD so far. Among those, 61 face the highest level of discipline recommended by the CCRB for serious cases of misconduct, which involves an administrative trial at One Police Plaza in Manhattan.</p><p>However, only 24 of those more serious cases have been finalized as of yet. Among those, the NYPD has only decided to impose discipline on 10 officers – translating into a concurrence rate of just 42% between what the CCRB recommended and what the NYPD carried out.</p><p>Under the CCRB’s structure, the police commissioner has ultimate authority over disciplinary action.</p><p>CCRB Executive Director Jonathan Darche said it’s still too early to tell whether the rate will improve as more cases are tried under NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell, who succeeded Dermot Shea in January.</p><p>“I&#x27;m very hopeful that the police commissioner will concur with the recommendation made by the CCRB, and her reputation from her prior job is that she takes discipline very seriously,” Darche said in an interview with Gothamist.</p><p>The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Complaints stemming from police action during the 2020 protests, following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, have proven to be a challenge for the CCRB to investigate. Scenes of police action were often chaotic. Videos from the protests, which spanned several weeks, showed police pushing and pepper spraying seemingly peaceful protestors, kettling groups of demonstrators and hitting some civilians with batons.</p><p>Current and former CCRB employees who’ve spoken with Gothamist, but who did not want to be named out of fear of retaliation, said they routinely encountered 2020 protest cases where officers covered their shield numbers, wore police helmets with numbers that did not match their department IDs, and where the NYPD did not adequately track the locations it was dispatching officers to during specific times and days. They also said the department was slow to turn over body-worn camera footage in the early stages of investigations and that the pandemic disrupted the process of interviewing officers.</p><p>Of the 2020 protest cases that have been fully investigated, 32% were closed because investigators were unable to identify officers, and just 36% have substantiated instances of misconduct, according to the CCRB — a rate that has not changed since its previous update on protest cases in December.</p><p>Now, the agency is racing to meet a statute of limitations deadline of May 4th for all protest-related complaints and other cases that arose during then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s emergency pandemic orders. The CCRB’s most recent monthly report showed the number of fully investigated case resolutions more than doubled from January to February this year and members of the board are holding more panel meetings in order to push cases through.</p><p>“The investigators, other members of staff, and the board members have been working really hard to close these cases in an efficient way as we get closer to that deadline,&quot; said Darche, who, along with members of the agency’s board, has repeatedly called on the city to take disciplinary decisions away from the commissioner and grant that power to the CCRB in order to strengthen its oversight ability.</p><p>In February of last year, amidst widespread calls for police reform, the CCRB signed a memorandum of understanding with the police department that introduced what it called a “disciplinary matrix” for substantiated complaints in which the NYPD agreed to follow set guidelines for disciplining officers for specific forms of misconduct.</p><p>But instead of increasing the overall number of times the NYPD followed disciplinary recommendations, the general concurrence rate – including more than 2020 protest-related cases – fell from 73% in 2020 to 68% in 2021. And in more serious cases of misconduct involving an administrative trial, the total concurrence rate was just 27% in 2021, according to testimony during a City Council hearing last week by the CCRB’s Interim Chair Arva Rice, who was appointed to the temporary position by Mayor Eric Adams last month.</p><p>“Unfortunately, results were not what the agency hoped for,” Rice told Councilmembers, “These low concurrence rates for cases where misconduct had been substantiated is an argument for why final disciplinary authority should not be left with the NYPD.”</p>",

                            "value": "<p>Phil Desgranges, supervising attorney for Legal Aid, said this means that everyone, including children, can potentially become “permanent suspects,” as each individual&#x27;s unique biological data could be stored in a suspect index and compared to evidence in future crimes, regardless of whether that person was charged with a crime.</p><p>“If the NYPD wanted to search someone’s cell phone, if they wanted to search your home, they would have to get a warrant or court order to do so,” Desgranges said. “But here, they’re getting this ability to effectively search your genetic material perpetually without any authorization from a court, and without any knowledge of the person whose DNA is being taken.”</p><p>The Legal Aid Society filed the class-action lawsuit against the city, along with top NYPD and medical examiner officials, on behalf of the more than 30,000 people with DNA in the suspect index as of the filing. Lawyers said they hoped to get the DNA profiles expunged from the index and stop the NYPD and medical examiner from taking and holding DNA in perpetuity.</p><p>It is unclear if other police departments around the country collect DNA from people who have not yet been convicted or even charged with crimes. Attorneys from Legal Aid said they were unaware of this practice elsewhere.</p><p>The NYPD defended the practice as being in the service of justice to accurately identify perpetrators, build cases for investigators, and “bring closure to victims and their families,” according to Sgt. Edward Riley, an NYPD spokesman who commented to Gothamist via email on Monday.</p><p>“Behind every time the NYPD collects DNA from a suspect in a criminal investigation, there is a crime victim who is suffering and seeking justice,” Riley said.</p><p>He did not respond to questions about specific allegations in the suit.</p><p>“The NYPD’s investigations and tactics, including the collection of DNA, are guided by what is authorized by the law, the wealth of case law from the courts, and the best practices of the law enforcement community,” he said.</p><p>The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-dna-scientists-nypd-collection-methods-20201012-zcdwnqxzjnat7h6vwws6rih5yi-story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that it will not analyze DNA unless there’s criminal evidence for it to be compared to. On Monday, a spokesperson released a statement in response to the filing of the suit saying “the local DNA database complies with all applicable laws and is managed and used in accordance with the highest scientific standards set by independent accrediting bodies that have regularly reapproved the existence of the database.”</p><p>Shakira Leslie, 26, was a named plaintiff in the case. She was arrested in 2019 after a gun was found in a vehicle she and four others occupied during a police stop. She said she was later held at a precinct for 16 hours, where she endured an intense interrogation.</p><p>Twelve hours went by before officers asked her if she wanted a bottle of water, she said.</p><p>“I was starving, I was dehydrated, I was everything there was … I was definitely going to drink that water by the time they asked me,” she said in an interview.</p><p>But that water bottle was how her DNA was collected, her attorneys said. Ultimately, her DNA was compared with DNA on the weapon. Without a match, she was exonerated and all charges were dismissed, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>But she was still shocked to learn that her DNA was even collected in the first place, she said.</p><p>“I’m an innocent person,” she said. “My DNA shouldn’t have to be there.”</p><p>Leslie, who has never been convicted of a crime, was 24 when the incident happened. And years later, she said, she still feels on edge around sirens and police.</p><p>“I have no trust,” she said. “Give people the option. Let people give the option to give their consent. Don’t treat an innocent person like a criminal. And that’s what they did to me.”</p><p>In recent years, officials removed thousands of DNA samples from the suspect database, mostly because they weren’t convicted or suspected of any crimes, according to the medical examiner&#x27;s office. And as of this month, there were 31,826 samples stored, <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ocme/services/ldis-tally.page\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYPD data</a> showed.</p><p>Desgranges said &quot;the trap is set&quot; oftentimes before suspects even enter the interrogation room, where detectives have already wiped down the room&#x27;s tabletops with Clorox to remove anyone else&#x27;s strands of hair or remnants of skin containing DNA. It is not until after the suspect enters the room when an offer for a drink, for example, is made, the supervising attorney said.</p><p>A video obtained by Legal Aid showed one officer pointing to a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/455960394\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">water bottle</a>, which a suspect took a drink from. After he was handcuffed and led out of the room, an officer returned to collect the bottle. Another video showed a suspect being offered a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/393278124\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Newport</a> cigarette. The ashtray was seen later being emptied into an evidence bag.</p><p>Suspects are forbidden from taking their trash, like water bottles and soda cans, out of the room, the lawsuit alleged. A copy of the NYPD Detective Guide gives instructions on how to secretly collect the DNA, according to the lawsuit, and the guide neither mandates nor recommends consent.</p><p>The NYPD did not respond to a question about whether officers continue this practice.</p><p>Unlike state and federal DNA databases, New York City’s is not subject to legislative oversight and restrictions on whose DNA can be stored. The New York State database only collects the DNA of those who have been convicted, as per state law.</p><p>An NYPD official told the City Council in February 2020 that it would gather demographic information on those in the DNA suspect database. But the NYPD did not provide such information when Gothamist asked on Monday. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said it doesn’t maintain such information.</p><p>“We need to reign in this lawless and unregulated taking and indexing of primarily Black and Latinx people’s DNA,” Desgranges said, referring to the fact that most people arrested by the NYPD are not white. “I’m sure wealthy, white New Yorkers would not want to hand over their DNA to the government, and there should not be one policy for primarily poor, Black, Latinx folks and a different policy for people who are much more privileged.”</p><p><i>This story has been updated.</i></p>",

                            "value": "<p>City Council members pushed back on key tenets of the NYPD’s new crime fighting strategies and demanded justification for its multibillion-dollar budget at a hearing Friday.</p><p>The discussion, part of ongoing preliminary budget hearings this month, came as the rate of violent crime has risen in the city, prompting Mayor Eric Adams and the NYPD to push for a more aggressive approach to policing. But some Council members, while not expressly pushing to “defund the police&quot; -- a term that&#x27;s proven divisive -- said they were concerned that billions of dollars to finance the NYPD could be used instead for social services. They argue such reallocations to other city agencies could also increase safety on the streets and in the subways.</p><p>The debate reflects a citywide conversation as the city returns to normalcy -- and as commuters return to public transit, which has seen a series of high-profile incidents of violence.</p><p>“We’re working very hard to restore that sense of order, that sense of calm, that sense of safety into the transit system,” Chief of Transit Jason Wilcox told members of the Council’s Public Safety Committee. “We’re addressing quality of life.”</p><p>There has been a dramatic increase in arrests in the transit system this year due to a new focus on issuing summonses for minor crimes. More than 1,000 have been issued so far this year for smoking, plus 200 for urination and 470 for “being outstretched,” or taking up more than one seat on a train car, according to statistics provided by the NYPD during the hearing.</p><p>But when Queens Councilmember Tiffany Cabán asked “for the total number of officers tasked with removing homeless New Yorkers from the subways,” and how much it costs, Wilcox didn’t directly answer. He also rejected the idea that police were “removing” the homeless.</p><p>NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell then interjected. “We’re not removing people from the subway; we’re endeavoring to provide services to them to get them out of the subway, a condition they probably don’t want to be in,” she said.</p><p>Sewell added that if people are not breaking the law in the subway system, police are not forcing them out.</p><p>Sewell opened the hearing by ticking off statistics showing an increase in arrests this year in a variety of major crime categories compared to the same time last year: Homicides (20%), rape (40%), felony assault (18%), and robbery (24%).</p><p>In all, the NYPD budget for the current fiscal year is $5.6 billion, 90% of which is personnel costs, Sewell said. With pensions and debt service factored in, the budget is roughly $11 billion, according to the <a href=\"https://cbcny.org/research/six-fast-facts-about-nypds-preliminary-fy2023-budget?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Six+Fast+Facts+about+the+NYPD%27s+Preliminary+FY2023+Budget\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Citizens Budget Commission</a>. Adams’s proposed budget would leave police spending relatively flat next year, though overtime costs could exceed projections.</p><p>Still, Caban said, “your budget is bigger than the Ukrainian military [<a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11862\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$4.2 billion</a>].” She then listed city agencies providing social services that get a fraction of the money that the NYPD does. “It sounds to me like these agencies are facing the challenge of actually doing more with less because of the billions per year your department demands.”</p><p>Brooklyn Councilmember Charles Barron similarly clashed with NYPD brass by saying that policing doesn’t improve public safety, with money wasted on overtime and legal settlements involving allegations of police abuse. He said money needs to be moved from the “bloated police budget” and into social services.</p><p>“You just said crime has gone up -- with $11 billion and 50,000 police officers,” he said. “The causes of crime is not a lack of policing. The causes of crime is poverty, unemployment, mental health, illness, drug addiction, homelessness, education or lack thereof. The answer to crime is not more policing.”</p><p>He also cited the names of those killed by police officers, and referred to Sewell being a Black woman. “We don’t need a change in the complexion or gender of the police commissioner, we need a change in the direction of police policies,” Barron said.</p><p>NYPD’s top brass also detailed a key component of Adams’ plan to stem the rise in gun violence since the pandemic: The new <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/adams-revamps-anti-gun-unit-as-nyc-grapples-with-deadly-week\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">neighborhood safety teams</a>, made up of groups of officers who target those who carry guns in the 30 most violence precincts. So far, 26 of the planned 34 neighborhood safety teams have been deployed, with 176 officers now on the street. Ultimately, more than 500 officers could be on these teams. The teams deployed this week and executed 17 arrests, according to the NYPD.</p><p>Similar squads in the past used violence against New Yorkers at disproportionate rates, which is why they were discontinued under the previous NYPD administration. But, Sewell said, “we learned from the mistakes of the past when we reimplemented these teams.”</p>",

                            "value": "<p>An Ernest Hemingway quote that celebrates the “hunting of man” is plastered on the wall of a Brooklyn police precinct house, according to a photo obtained by Gothamist — and the NYPD is dismissing calls by local officials and advocates to remove it.</p><p>The passage, which police have used in years past to similar outcry, opens Hemingway’s 1936 short story “On The Blue Water.” It’s currently inscribed on the wall of the 71st precinct in Crown Heights and reads, “There is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter.”</p><p>The NYPD is defending the quote as literary inspiration that captures the “exhilarating” nature of hunting dangerous criminals. But a local Council member and criminal justice advocates say the quote glorifies violence against their community.</p><p>Its existence emerges as Mayor Eric Adams this week <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/adams-revamps-anti-gun-unit-as-nyc-grapples-with-deadly-week\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">redeploys teams of anti-gun units</a> within the NYPD — a reincarnation of similar units that were disbanded in the wake of the George Floyd protests after earning a reputation for police abuse and violence.</p><p>“The history of policing started as an intentional attempt to violently ‘hunt’ Black people while quelling opposition and rebellion,” said Councilmember Crystal Hudson, who represents the predominantly Black neighborhood where the precinct is located, in a statement sent to Gothamist. “We cannot in good conscience divorce this history from the policing we see in our communities today.”</p><p>Deputy Commissioner John Miller, who currently heads the NYPD’s communications office, told Gothamist that criticism of the quote was a disservice both to the dangerous work of police officers and the famed American author.</p><p>“To insinuate any meaning to the Hemingway quote other than the fact that tracking and arresting violent, armed criminals can be exhilarating, rewarding, and often dangerous is a disservice to the meaning of the Hemingway quote and to the officers who do this work,” Miller wrote in an email.</p><p>The quote has been on the wall since February of 1998, Miller added. It does not appear to violate any department policies.</p><p>It’s not the first time the Hemingway line has stirred controversy for city police. In the 1990s, members of the NYPD’s Street Crimes Unit were <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130722224132/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/06/members_of_the.php\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">known to wear t-shirts</a> emblazoned with the phrase.</p><p>The quote also <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-officers-caught-wearing-t-shirts-professing-their-love-for-hunting-of-man\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made headlines in 2013</a>, when it was spotted on the back of an on-duty member of the NYPD Warrant Squad, in apparent violation of department’s uniform policy.</p><p>The department has also <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-defends-challenge-coins-dubbing-east-flatbush-precinct-fort-jah\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">faced questions</a> about a fundraising “challenge coin” that references Brooklyn’s 67th precinct and featured the quote alongside an image of officers chasing a dark-skinned man with dreadlocks. A police spokesperson has denied that the coin, which appeared online alongside an official NYPD coin, had any link to the department.</p><p>Loyda Colon, the executive director of the advocacy group Justice Committee, said the Hemingway passage was “on brand” for the NYPD, likening its popularity to the Punisher, a violent vigilante comic book character whose skull logo has been <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/marvel-punisher-police-cops-military-fandom.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">embraced by both police and far-right groups</a> nationally.<br/></p><p>“It accurately describes the longstanding culture of violence within the NYPD and the terror it inflicts on low-income Black, Latinx and other communities of color in our City,” Colon said.<br/></p><p>Colon also highlighted the quote in the context of the return of a plainclothes anti-crime unit, which was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/nyregion/nypd-plainclothes-cops.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disbanded in 2020 by former Commissioner Dermot Shea</a> in the wake of the George Floyd protests. A similar group was <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/adams-revamps-anti-gun-unit-as-nyc-grapples-with-deadly-week\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revamped</a> by Adams this week with a new name and new protocols designed to protect against abuse; its rollout has raised fears among criminal justice advocates.</p><p>&quot;We must prepare for the NYPD&#x27;s hunting of our people to increase exponentially,” Colon said.</p><p>Adams’ office did not respond to a request for comment.<br/></p><p>A 2020 <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5984aae4e58c62ee930f614a/t/5f73512fd4670d519780febc/1601392946271/PSL_CCRB_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> from the Public Safety Lab at New York University found that precincts with higher percentages of Black residents experienced a disproportionately high number of misconduct complaints against officers.</p><p>Advocates noted that the relationship between the 71st precinct and the community it polices has been particularly strained in recent years. Officers from the precinct were involved in the killing of two Black men – <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/they-murdered-my-son-hundreds-rally-after-nypd-killing-of-saheed-vassell\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Saheed Vessel</a> in 2018 and <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/family-brooklyn-man-fatally-shot-police-disputes-nypds-suicide-cop-narrative\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eudes Pierre</a> last year – both of whom were believed to be undergoing mental health episodes when they were shot.</p><p>But Miller, the NYPD deputy commissioner, maintained that the Hemingway quote should not be seen as threatening, but as a tribute to the fearlessness of local officers.</p><p>“The Hemingway quote is one of his best known,” Miller wrote. “The NYPD officers who have worked out of that room, over that near quarter-century [since the quote was inscribed], have shared the responsibility of tracking down and arresting violent felons whose victims are members of that community.”</p>",

However, as of December 2021, 69 of those positions, including investigators, have not been filled.</p><p>“It&#x27;s unclear the extent to which the vacancies result from CCRB not having identified candidates for various position or difficulty they are having securing approval from the mayor&#x27;s office to hire the candidate that they have identified,” said Bernard O’Brien, a senior budget analyst at the IBO who authored the report.</p><p>In response to a request for comment from Gothamist, a spokesperson for the mayor&#x27;s office, Jonah Allon, said the CCRB&#x27;s current funding and the number of personnel it is authorized to hire exceeds the city charter&#x27;s mandated levels.  </p><p>“Mayor Adams has consistently said that our city can have the safety we need and the justice we deserve, and the CCRB is a vital partner in those efforts,&quot; Allon said. &quot;We have accelerated their hiring process to ensure the agency can fulfill its critical oversight mission.”</p><p>But O’Brien said the CCRB acknowledged that the lack of staff was contributing to delays in completing investigations, in addition to disruptions brought on by the pandemic.</p><p>According to the Preliminary Mayor’s Management Report released in February, the average time it takes the agency to complete an investigation into alleged misconduct now stands at 586 days, more than four times the CCRB’s target of 140 days.</p><p>A spokesperson for the CCRB, Clio Calvo-Platero, said the agency is working with the Office of Management and Budget and expects to fill the positions soon.</p><p>At the same time that the agency has faced a staffing shortage, it has also recently acquired a slate of new powers to investigate additional types of police misconduct.</p><p>In December of last year, the City Council granted the CCRB the power to self-initiate complaints against officers based on video documentation and other evidence. In the past, it relied solely on official complaints filed by civilians. It also recently prevailed in a lawsuit brought by the Police Benevolent Association that attempted to block the agency from investigating complaints of sexual misconduct by members of the NYPD.</p><p>In April of 2021, the City Council passed legislation that gave the CCRB authority to establish a new unit within the agency to investigate racial profiling and biased-based policing. According to sources within the agency who did not want to be named because they weren’t authorized to divulge the information to the press, progress in getting the unit up and running has been stalled by a lack of staff and difficulty in hiring.</p>",

It came as the city undergoes another week of unsettling violence.</p><p>Authorities on Tuesday <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/dc-police-man-accused-of-shooting-homeless-people-arrested\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">arrested</a> a man they say fatally shot two homeless men and injured three others in New York City and Washington, D.C. On the same day, police <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/moma-stabbing-suspect-arrested-in-philadelphia\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">arrested</a> a man accused of stabbing two employees at the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>During a press conference at a police training center in Queens, Adams described the teams as “an elite group of men and women with specialized training and skill set to zero in on gun violence.”</p><p>Over time, the unit will grow to 400 officers.</p><p>“That is a new corner we are turning in policing and public safety,” the mayor said. “We&#x27;re going to make sure we use the balance of public safety to do it right. We&#x27;re going to engage with the public.”</p><p>The mayor also criticized the public for sometimes recording videos of officers during arrests, which he said hindered their ability to do their jobs effectively. There have been several instances of police misconduct over recent years that <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-officer-who-put-man-illegal-chokehold-now-charged-strangulation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bystanders&#x27; mobile devices have captured</a> and shared.</p><p>Adams called on the public to &quot;stop being on top&quot; of officers carrying out their jobs.</p><p>&quot;If an officer is on the ground wrestling with someone that has a gun, they should not have to worry about someone standing over them with a camera,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s a proper way to police and there&#x27;s a proper way to document.&quot;</p><p>Three months into office, Adams, a former NYPD police captain, has sought to address rising crime through a multi-pronged approach that includes investments in youth jobs, mental health outreach and targeted policing. But he has yet to win support from key Democratic lawmakers in Albany for his push to revise the state’s bail reform laws.</p><p>Alluding to those efforts on Wednesday, Adams said, “We&#x27;re not going to get caught up in a politics of fighting crime, because it&#x27;s not going to matter what laws are passed anywhere in this state. We&#x27;re going to focus on our job.”</p><p>However, some experts, including former NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea, have criticized the concept of specialized anti-gun units as an outdated and counterproductive policing tactic that has led to bad headlines and a cascade of lawsuits. In 2020, Shea disbanded the units after they were found to be involved in many shootings and creating tensions within communities they patrolled.</p><p>On Friday, community advocacy groups, including The Legal Aid Society, said they were planning to host a rally outside City Hall to protest racist policing practices and any increases to the NYPD budget. In a press release, the groups also cited the use of gang databases that law enforcement critics say are unreliable and misidentifies many men of color as gang members. They argue that the new unit is merely a rebranding.</p><p>Unlike that version, the new unit of officers will not be in plainclothes, but wear modified uniforms that make them identifiable as police officers to the public.</p>",

NYPD Chief of Training Juanita Holmes said the seven-day intensive included lessons in “scenario-based constitutional policing, courtroom testimony, investigative encounters, car stop workshops” as well as community relations.</p><p>Police officials said officers were invited to volunteer but that applicants were accepted only after a thorough vetting that included a review of their disciplinary history and body camera footage.</p><p>The mayor delivered his remarks fresh off a trip to Miami, where he participated in a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-mayor-adams-cryptocurrencies-miami-visit-20220316-v7zsxv3xinafvkcz6acn6njipm-story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrency conference</a>. Since becoming mayor, Adams has been trying to attract cryptocurrency investors to New York City.</p><p>He has followed through on a promise to convert his first three paychecks into two digital currencies known as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

She had left to go to Joe&#x27;s Pub for a performance by one of her students when she was shoved.</p><p>According <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/nyregion/barbara-maier-gustern-voice-coach-attack.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to The New York Times</a>, Gustern was awake initially after the attack, telling a friend at the scene, “I’ve never been hit so hard in my life.&quot; She also reportedly told police that her assailant &quot;shouted a derogatory term before assaulting her.&quot; She was initially taken to a nearby hospital, then transferred to Bellevue Medical Center, where she underwent emergency surgery.</p><p>On Saturday, Gustern&#x27;s grandson AJ Gustern wrote <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barbara.gustern/posts/10164014400123084\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on Facebook</a> that she had suffered &quot;traumatic damage to the left side of her brain, and has been unconscious the entire time&quot; since reaching the hospital.</p><p>&quot;I apologize if it takes me awhile to respond, but I am incomprehensibly broken inside,&quot; he added. &quot;I struggle to understand and cope with this world on a daily basis, and frankly this is beyond my ability to bear.&quot;</p><p>As she recounted <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/02/04/singing-teacher-to-the-stars-turns-85-with-a-little-help-from-debbie-harry/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to the New York Post</a> in 2020, Gustern grew up in Indiana, came to NYC with Broadway aspirations, and ended up becoming a celebrated vocal coach. In the 1980s, she worked with singer and performance artist Diamanda Galás, which led to her coaching Blondie’s Debbie Harry and being introduced to the downtown NYC cabaret scene. Her career eventually led to her working with the cast of Daniel Fish’s 2019 Broadway revival of <i>Oklahoma!</i></p><p>Earlier in the day on March 10, Gustern <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barbara.gustern/posts/10164010788083084\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on Facebook</a> that she was feeling optimistic about the future.</p><p>&quot;Is there a sudden shift in planetary alignment?&quot; she wrote. &quot;Something is cosmically different for me. I went through a period of feeling detached. I couldn&#x27;t remember lyrics. I felt like my voice had totally abandoned me. The thought of doing a show was like sentencing me to be tortured. But as of today all that is reversed. I feel full of creativity, joy at working on a beautiful show with people I adore and totally respect. I feel like a singer again for the first time in forever. What happened? I haven&#x27;t a clue. But whatever it is I am more than grateful. I am extatic [sic].&quot;</p>",

Police said he arrived at the museum on Saturday planning to see a film, but was turned away because of two prior incidents of misbehavior.</p><p>He allegedly responded by jumping the turnstile and counter at the museum, cornering the two employees and stabbing them in the back and neck. Both employees were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries.</p><p>Cabana took to social media in the aftermath of the attack, appearing to downplay the crime while taunting police for not catching him. On Monday afternoon, a church in Midtown was <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/police-evacuate-midtown-church-as-hunt-for-moma-stabbing-suspect-continues\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">evacuated after police received a tip</a> about a man matching Cabana’s description.</p><p>Friends interviewed by Gothamist said Cabana had suffered from mental health struggles that worsened during the pandemic, and had engaged in alarming social media behavior in recent months. They said they pleaded with him to turn himself in to police in recent days.</p><p>The Museum of Modern Art is reopened to the public on Tuesday morning.</p><p><i>This story has been updated with additional information</i></p>",

The shootings occurred between March 3rd and March 9th. </p><p>During a press conference Tuesday, NYPD officials said their detectives were working with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to bring charges against the same person for the shooting of two homeless men in Lower Manhattan this past Saturday. </p><p>The gunman, who does not have a known connection to New York City, is believed to have arrived at Penn Station shortly after 3:00 a.m. on Saturday. He is accused of shooting a man sleeping in SoHo in the forearm at 4:30 a.m., then fleeing after the victim pretended to call the police.</p><p>Less than two hours later, the same suspect is believed to have fired five shots at another homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. </p><p>Police used ballistic evidence to identify the shooter, as well as “multiple tips that were very instrumental” to the arrest, Chief of Department James Essig said on Tuesday. The connection between the D.C. and New York City attacks was first noticed by a detective with the Metropolitan Police Department, who previously lived in Queens and followed the NYPD on social media, he added.  </p><p>It remains unclear what brought the alleged shooter to New York City. Records show Brevard was arrested several times in the past, including for felony assault and several misdemeanors, though never in the New York area. </p><p>The suspect’s aunt, Sheila Brevard, said she was surprised to learn of her nephew’s arrest on Tuesday.</p><p>“We are really in the dark, we don’t know what took place or what type of evidence. All we see is his face on TV,” she told Gothamist. “We give our condolences to those families.”</p><p>The spree of shootings come amid a stark increase in the <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/number-of-homeless-people-killed-in-nyc-is-increasing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">killing of homeless people</a> in recent years, both locally and across the country.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, Mayor Eric Adams touted the coordinated effort between D.C., New York and the federal government that brought a “cold-blooded killer to justice.” </p><p>“Gun violence against anyone, let alone our most vulnerable populations, is sick, but thanks to the coordination between different levels of law enforcement and the public’s help, those experiencing homelessness can breathe a sigh of relief today,” he said.</p><p><i>This story has been updated with additional information. </i></p>",

Police officials initially said he had died of a gunshot wound on his right leg, but had walked that back by Monday morning. The report of a gunshot led to suspicion that the victim may have been among those targeted by a suspect authorities believe has been targeting people experiencing street homelessness in New York and Washington.</p><p>The NYPD said the man had some sort of puncture wound, though it wasn’t clear whether or not it was from a gun or if it contributed to the man’s death. They also said they found drug paraphernalia at the scene and thought the man could have possibly died from an overdose, according to information provided by the NYPD. The city’s medical examiner didn’t return a request for comment immediately.</p><p>The man’s discovery came as NYPD Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell and Washington D.C Chief of Police Robert Contee announced they were on the hunt for a man who shot five homeless people in both cities and killed two of them — one in New York City on Saturday morning and one in D.C. on March 9th. All the attacks took place in the predawn hours while the men were sleeping.</p>",

He fled the building and remained at large Sunday, the NYPD said.</p><p>Friends of the suspect who saw the footage, along with social media posts they attributed to him, said they were in disbelief, claiming the behavior did not match the Broadway-loving usher they’d known for decades.</p><p>&quot;It wouldn’t have ever occurred to me that he might lash out,&quot; said Tara Varney, who said she studied theater with Cabana at Missouri State University in Springfield, and had remained close to him.</p><p>Varney and other friends said that Cabana had a history of mental illness, which appeared to worsen during the pandemic. A public Facebook post shared on an account that three friends said belongs to Cabana called the stabbing a “total frame job,” while seeming to acknowledge that he had previous altercations at the museum.</p><p>“Bipolar is a tough road to hoe,” one of those posts from Sunday read. “Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde on the 2 ‘supposed’ days I ‘acted up: 2/24 +. 3/9. Total blind side when I got ‘the letter,’” an apparent reference to the letter revoking his MoMA membership.</p><p>It continued: “It wasn&#x27;t SCREAM 6 at MoMA it was poke poke poke wake-up call.”</p><p>Multiple people close to Cabana said they noticed a shift in his social media presence at the start of the pandemic, as his musings shifted from critiquing films to posts filled with anger directed at tourists who did not follow COVID protocols, as well as Trump, whose leadership Cabana said allowed the pandemic to worsen.</p><p>“His politics are liberal,” Varney said. “He’d get more worked up about them than I would choose to.”</p>",

He was ushering for a long time and he would talk about the shows and everything.”</p><p>Anna Blair, an actor and singer who said she knew Cabana in college, recalled his “support group” of friends who had looked out for him in the past.</p><p>“COVID hit him hard as far as loneliness,” Blair said. “Nobody was able to visit him.”</p><p>Cabana had come to the museum on Saturday to watch a film, but was turned away by employees because his membership had been revoked “as a result of two incidents involving disorderly conduct here at the museum on two separate dates in recent days,” according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller. Both victims, a 24-year-old man and 24-year-old woman who worked at the museum, were expected to survive, officials said.</p><p>At a press conference on Monday, Mayor Eric Adams said he was praying for the victims, and vowed to catch the alleged assailant.</p><p>“We know who he is, and the police department will apprehend him,” Adams said.</p>",

The shootings took place between March 3 and March 12, with three reported in Washington, D.C. and two in New York City.</p><p>&quot;Given the similarity in the modus operandi of the perpetrator, common circumstances involved in each shooting, circumstances of the victims and recovered evidence, the NYPD, the [Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.] and the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] will jointly investigate these offenses,&quot; the NYPD said in a statement Sunday.</p><p>The NYPD said the first shooting offense occurred on March 3 near the 1100 block of New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. around 4 a.m., when authorities found an adult homeless man with gunshot wounds. He was taken to a nearby hospital with non-life threatening injuries, cops said.</p><p>On March 8, another shooting was reported near the 1700 block of H Street in Washington, D.C. around 1:21 a.m., when police found another homeless man with gunshot wounds that were later deemed non-life threatening.</p><p>A tent fire was later reported near the 400 block of New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. on March 9 around 2:54 a.m., where police found a dead man who was also homeless. The chief medical examiner&#x27;s office later ruled the man&#x27;s death a homicide after finding multiple stab and gunshot wounds to his body, police said.</p><p>The first New York shooting of this kind was reported on March 12, when a 38-year-old man was shot while sleeping on King Street between Varick Street and 6th Avenue around 4:30 a.m. During <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1502839076478599169\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a press conference</a> on Saturday night, NYPD Deputy Chief Hank Sautner said the victim woke up when shot and asked, “What are you doing?” The assailant fled, and the victim, who was shot in the arm, was listed in stable condition at Bellevue.</p><p>Another shooting, this time fatal, was reported later that day around 6 a.m. outside of 148 Lafayette St. just north of Canal Street, according to an NYPD spokesperson. The victim was found dead in his sleeping bag later in the day around 5 p.m. with gunshot wounds to the head and neck, the NYPD said.</p><p>&quot;The connectivity here is obviously that both gentlemen are homeless,&quot; Sautner said after the second New York shooting.</p><p>Less than 24 hours later, on Sunday night, a man believed to be homeless was killed in Tribeca. Police initially reported the death as resulting from a gunshot wound, but later suggested it may have been a drug overdose and thus unrelated to the string of fatal shootings.</p><p>“Our homeless population is one of our most vulnerable and an individual preying on them as they sleep is an exceptionally heinous crime,&quot; Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell said in a statement. &quot;We will use every tool, every technique and every partner to bring the killer to justice.”</p><p>Police have released stills from the surveillance video that show the suspect in the first two New York shootings, and are asking for help in identifying him.</p><p>At a press conference on Saturday night, Mayor Eric Adams described the crimes as a &quot;chilling&quot; act of &quot;cold-blooded murder,&quot; and said the incidents were a &quot;clear and horrific intentional act&quot; targeting homeless individuals.</p><p>“Two individuals were shot while sleeping on the street,” Adams said over the weekend as news of the city shootings developed. “Not committing a crime, but sleeping on the streets.”</p><p>Anyone with knowledge of these incidents was asked to call the NYPD&#x27;s Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).</p><p><i>This story has been updated to reflect new information provided by the NYPD regarding the death of a homeless man Sunday night.</i></p>",

It also comes as Adams was consistently pressed on when the teams would be deployed.</p><p>&quot;In the beginning when we started discussing these teams we said we were going to do an extensive amount of vetting and training,&quot; Sewell said at a news conference Friday. &quot;And we were going to roll the initiative out. That initiative will be activated this Monday, [March] 14.&quot;</p><p>A total of 25 teams consisting of five officers each will be deployed starting Monday, and focused on removing guns off the streets. Sewell said parts of the discussion in preparation for the much-anticipated teams involved examining the &quot;mistakes of the past.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The officers are being trained in the constitution, community interaction, car stops, use of force,&quot; Sewell said. &quot;What we really want to emphasize is there&#x27;s a community component to this training as well where we talk to the community and find out exactly what the changes are that they like to see, what their concerns were in the past and what they can speak to moving forward.&quot;</p><p>From the days of the campaign trail to leading the city, Adams has sought to bring crime down as a way of charting a pathway to economic recovery. The most available police statistics show major crime is up 47% across the city compared to the same time a year ago. Crime in every major category, including murder and assault, are up. Shootings have also increased compared to the same time last year, with the number of incidents up 14% from 168 to 192. The number of shooting victims has also jumped from 181 to 215 the same time last year, an 18.8% spike.</p><p>Police reform groups and lawmakers have worried that the neighborhood safety teams will be akin to the anti-crime teams that were disbanded under Mayor Bill de Blasio. At the news conference Friday, Chief of Department Kenneth Corey said officers from these teams have been trained in &quot;minimal force techniques.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They receive advanced tactics, car stops, de-escalation is central, communication skills is a big part of that,” Corey said.</p><p>Sewell also insisted that unlike the anti-crime team, in which plainclothes officers rode in unmarked police cars, neighborhood safety teams will be clearly identifiable.</p><p>“The uniform on the back plainly states ‘NYPD Police,’&quot; she said. &quot;They are there for the safety of the community and to get the violent offenders off the streets.&quot;</p><p>When asked when she expects results from the team, Sewell said she certainly expects them &quot;right away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They need to have time to get out there and be effective,&quot; Sewell said.</p>",

Three people in the car were taken into custody for questioning, officials said. The police did not provide an update on the man’s condition on Monday morning. </p><p>The department <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doi/reports/pdf/2015/2015-10-01-Pr_uofrpt.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prohibits officers </a>from discharging their firearms “at or from a moving vehicle unless deadly physical force is being used against the police officer or another person present, by means other than a moving vehicle.”</p><p>The policy was enacted in 1972, after a police officer in Staten Island <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/10-year-old-boys-shot-dead-cops-wake-up-call-article-1.2995332\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fatally shot an 11-year-old</a> who was riding in the backseat of a stolen Pontiac. It has been widely hailed by criminal justice experts, who <a href=\"http://www.policeforum.org/assets/guidingprinciples1.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attribute </a>it to a steep drop in lethal use of force incidents in New York City.</p><p>Corey acknowledged the use of force guidelines on Sunday night, but said the incident would be reviewed by department officials. </p><p>“The department’s policy is not to shoot at a moving vehicle unless something other than the vehicle is being used as a weapon,” he said. “However there is a carve-out there that gets reviewed on a case by case basis by the first deputy commissioners use of force review board.”</p>",

The incident occurred as the train was pulling into the Lorimer Street station around 7:42 p.m., according to the NYPD.</p><p>Trains were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/1499908594078212101?s=20&amp;t=anPfNy-DtoPT2ukvTTreVA\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">delayed in both directions</a> as emergency medical technicians responded, but ut the woman was pronounced dead at the scene a short while later, at 8:20 p.m., said Detective Sophia Mason, a spokesperson for the NYPD. The woman’s identity had not been released as of Saturday morning.</p><p>This is the latest in a string of subway deaths and injuries in recent weeks that have prompted the Metropolitan Transit Authority and Mayor Eric Adams to grapple with how to improve subway safety – including <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/mta-will-pilot-protective-platform-doors-3-subway-stations\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a pilot</a> to test out protective platform doors at three stations. Several incidents occurred just over the past week.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://patch.com/new-york/astoria-long-island-city/man-hit-subway-train-astoria-police\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a man was hit</a> by a train at the Steinway Street station in Astoria and rushed to Elmhurst hospital in unknown condition. Two days later, another man was <a href=\"https://www.audacy.com/1010wins/news/local/two-new-yorkers-saved-after-falling-on-train-tracks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fatally struck</a> by a 7 train in Queens after falling onto the tracks at the Junction Boulevard station.</p><p>Others narrowly dodged a similar fate with the help of good Samaritans. A 52-year-old man fell onto the tracks at the Fourth Avenue and 9th Street subway station in Park Slope Wednesday afternoon. A fellow straphanger jumped down and saved him by rolling him under the platform before leaping out of harm’s way, <a href=\"https://patch.com/new-york/parkslope/good-samaritan-saves-man-who-fell-park-slope-train-track-nypd\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Patch reported</a>. Another man who fell on the tracks that day at the Times Square station was rescued by two people who <a href=\"https://www.audacy.com/1010wins/news/local/two-new-yorkers-saved-after-falling-on-train-tracks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pulled him back</a> onto the platform.</p><p>No one was reported to have been pushed in these incidents, but there is a “growing problem of people getting on the tracks,” Janno Lieber, the chair and CEO of the MTA, told Fox-5 Thursday evening. “We are determined to find new ways to attack this problem,” he said.</p><p>Lieber said that possible solutions could involve using laser technology and cameras to show “when people are getting into the wrong areas.” Lieber said this is something that the MTA began looking into before <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/police-man-arrested-fatally-pushing-woman-times-square-tracks-unprovoked-assault\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Go was pushed</a> onto the tracks in January.</p><p>After Friday night’s incident, service on the L train was suspended between Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn and 8th Avenue in Manhattan and was replaced by a shuttle. The MTA said regular service resumed shortly after 9 p.m.</p>",

He will also have to attend anger management or counseling classes and do 70 hours of community service, a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney said.</p><p>The charges stem from two arrests Wong was involved in while on the job that devolved into violence. In one incident in October of 2019, Wong punched a handcuffed 48-year-old man who was in a holding cell in an Upper Manhattan police precinct, after the man spit at officers. The man needed stitches above his eye, prosecutors said.</p><p>In April of 2020, during an arrest at an Upper West Side subway station, Wong pinned a 35-year-old man down with his knees and bounced on his back, punched him in the side of his face and taunted him, yelling, “I don’t give a f**k if you can breathe or not!,” according to prosecutors. The 35-year-old used anti-Asian slurs and kicked Wong in the leg before he struck back.</p><p>Wong earned more than $130,000 in salary, overtime and other pay in 2021, according to New York City payroll data. He has an upcoming disciplinary hearing on March 22, <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/administrative/trials.page\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to NYPD records.</a> An NYPD spokesperson said Wong was on modified duty and declined to comment further. His attorney, Andrew Quinn, didn’t immediately return a request for comment — neither did the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the union that represents Wong.</p><p>Police officers are <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/analyzing-323911-newly-released-records-nypd-misconduct\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rarely fired for substantiated cases of misconduct on the job,</a> and criminal charges for workplace conduct are exceedingly rare. Wong was <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-sergeant-charged-assault-attempted-assault-during-two-arrests\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">charged by former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance last summer</a>, though current District Attorney Alvin Bragg promised greater <a href=\"https://www.manhattanda.org/policemisconduct/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accountability for police misconduct as part of his campaign last year.</a></p><p>“Law enforcement officials are sworn to serve and protect their communities, including New Yorkers in their custody,” Bragg said in a statement. “In this case, Sergeant Wong violated not only his oath – but the law – during the violent arrests of two New Yorkers, on two separate occasions.”</p>",

She died Feb. 22.</p><p>The demonstrators held signs reading, “We Demand Real Solutions for Homeless and Mental” and, “Save Chinatown: Our Risk is Real.” Several speakers noted that homeless individuals had been connected to recent attacks and called for tougher enforcement and prevention efforts.</p><p>“We don&#x27;t want to be ignored,” said Jacky Wong of Concerned Citizens of East Broadway. “Because we feel like our risk is not recognized.”</p><p>The rally took place one block from the home of Christina Yuna Lee, 35, who was murdered in February in her apartment after being followed home. Police charged Assamad Nash, 25, with her murder, and said he’d been living in a nearby shelter.</p>",

The total of the city pension funds’ Russian assets were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-city-comptroller-suggest-russian-assets-divestment-2022-02-28/?taid=621cb493af8d2b00015719f4&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly worth about $271 million</a> last week.</p><p>“Freedom cannot be denied, here or anywhere. That’s why I stand in support of efforts to divest the city’s pension funds from Russian assets in light of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine — an unprovoked and unjustified war,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>The city has the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/nyregion/nyc-ukrainians.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">largest population of Ukrainians</a>—150,000—in the country.</p><p>The state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has also urged the state’s Common Retirement Fund, which covers more than a million state and local government employees, to review $110.8 million in existing investments in Russian assets.</p><p>Governor Kathy Hochul <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/hochul-announces-new-york-will-not-do-business-russia\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued an executive order</a> Sunday to end state investments and purchases that financially benefit Russia, for as long as the federal government’s economic sanctions continue.</p><p>“While American sanctions already prohibit investments in many Russian companies, I believe it is prudent to freeze purchases in all Russian companies due to the situation’s unpredictability and the likelihood that conditions will deteriorate,&quot; DiNapoli said in a statement Tuesday. &quot;This will ensure that the Fund does not increase its minimal exposure to the Russian economy while completing its divestment review, consistent with my fiduciary duty.&quot;</p>",

The report also found that Latino New Yorkers were overrepresented in prosecutions of these minor crimes.</p><p>“The data doesn’t prove bias, it just proves we’re getting inequitable outcomes,” said Michael Rempel, one of the authors of the study. “Whatever the reasons for the outcome, the upshot is we’re looking at vast over-involvement of Black and brown people in a misdemeanor justice system that doesn’t ultimately promote either accountability or fairness.”</p><p>Just 12% of the misdemeanor arrests in New York City resulted in a conviction in 2019 and 2020 combined, and only 9% brought a jail sentence. About a third resulted in a plea deal to a lesser offense, like a non-criminal violation.</p><p>Although the majority of those arrested for these minor crimes were not found guilty of a criminal violation, researchers said those caught up in the system still paid a cost while waiting in a holding cell for as long as 24 hours until an arraignment or navigating multiple hearings through an opaque court system.</p>",

That racial disparity “suggests that there could be explicit or implicit bias in these cases,” Rempel said.</p><p>The resisting arrest charge recently became a point of contention in Manhattan. The borough’s new district attorney, Alvin Bragg, promised during his campaign last year that he would not prosecute those who resist arrest if the charge isn’t accompanied by allegations of other crimes. Of this and other misdemeanors, he <a href=\"https://www.alvinbragg.com/declination\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>: “The punishments are disproportionately harsh, and fall disproportionately on the backs of people of color.”</p><p>Bragg <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/manhattan-da-bragg-tells-staff-stop-prosecuting-certain-offenses\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">followed through</a> on this shortly after taking office last month, but soon <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/bragg-walks-back-some-stances-maligned-policy-memo-amid-pressure\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">softened</a> his position in the face of criticism that he was going easy on repeat offenders as violent crime in the city was spiking. While the report doesn’t mention Bragg, its data back up his original assertion that the NYPD overwhelmingly uses the resisting arrest charge against Black people. In the two years studied, 65% of those arrested for resisting arrest were Black.</p><p>In response to the report, NYPD spokesperson Jessica McRorie said the department &quot;has been forging fundamental changes in policing&quot; over the last eight years. McRorie cited <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/patrol/neighborhood-coordination-officers.page\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">neighborhood policing</a>, which emphasizes individual officers’ engagement with the communities they patrol and a more narrowed focus on stopping the &quot;drivers&quot; of violence.</p><p>“The NYPD responds to and addresses crime complaints from the very communities it serves and we focus on areas where the highest concentrations of crime exist,” McRorie said in a statement to Gothamist. “These communities not only deserve but demand that police respond to reports of crime and apprehend those responsible.”</p><p>Richard Aborn, a former prosecutor in Manhattan and president of the nonprofit Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, also reviewed the report for Gothamist and said the racial disparities might be affected by geography, because certain neighborhoods are more heavily policed — which he said is justified.</p><p>“If we’re getting a lot of crime reports out of a certain neighborhood, I don’t know why we wouldn’t send more resources there,” he said. “You want to send your police where the crime is.”</p><p>But he found the data on crimes involving police discretion, like resisting arrest, troubling.</p><p>Aborn also said there must be some accountability for even low-level unlawful conduct.</p><p>“We have to ask ourselves whether or not as a society we’re going to insist on accountability for violating the law,” he said. “But accountability does not have to be tantamount to jail. Accountability can be taking steps to avoid future criminal conduct. That’s why diversion is so important.&quot;</p><p>Robert Gangi of the Manhattan-based Police Reform Organizing Project (PROP) released a study on racial discrepancies in arrests last week that mirrored what the Center for Court Innovation found.</p><p>“NYPD policing is blatantly racist,” Gangi said, pointing to years of arrest data his group has crunched showing similar racial disparities. “It’s a function of focus, and a focus of policy, based on where cops are deployed and the instructions they’re given. It’s purposeful, not accidental.”</p><p>PROP monitors arraignments in the city’s criminal courts. Gangi said he sat in on 14 arraignments in Manhattan court on Thursday, and all the defendants were Black or brown, with most facing low-level charges. Some were unhoused and mentally ill, and all but one walked out of the courtroom without jail time, he said.</p><p>And yet, he said, they were still harmed by the process.</p><p>“Targeting, harassing, sending a message to low-income people of color that we are policing you, we are constraining you, and we are in one way or another communicating to you, intentional or not, that your lives … don’t matter as much as white people.”</p><p>The report lists several recommendations for making law enforcement more racially equitable, including legalizing or decriminalizing certain violations disproportionately enforced against people of color, like misdemeanors that don’t involve violence such as property loss, low-level drug possession, subway turnstile jumping and prostitution. Such recommendations would require changing state law.</p><p>State Sen. Julia Salazar of Brooklyn, who chairs the Senate Committee on Crime and Correction, also reviewed the report at Gothamist’s request. In a written statement she said it “shows that even after years of reform efforts, the NYPD&#x27;s biased practices continue to cause trauma in our communities. The harm that is caused by the stark racially disparate arrest practices of the NYPD leads to short-term and long-term disruptions in the lives of many New Yorkers.”</p><p>Like with the <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/ny-nj-will-erase-nearly-million-marijuana-convictions-some-clearing-their-record-gets-tricky\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent decriminalization of marijuana</a>, Salazar said the legislature should decriminalize other low-level offenses in order to reduce arrests, lower incarceration, and stop racial disparities in policing.</p><p>The Center for Court Innovation, the New York nonprofit that published the study, was founded in part by the New York State Unified Court System. Its researchers identify ways to lower the jail population. They used data from the state Office of Court Administration for the report.</p><p>Researchers also pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/06/misdemeanor-prosecution-future-crime/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> in Boston that showed misdemeanor prosecutions lead to greater rates of rearrest. They recommended that certain offenses be handled outside of criminal court, and called for community service or other programs for those charged with nonviolent property crimes because such behavior, they said, often stems from poverty. The city already has diversion programs in which defendants are offered mental health or drug treatment, for example, in lieu of going to jail.</p>",

No, those days are over … The system was not made to be housing, it’s made to be transportation.”</p><p>Adams said people who reach the end of the line will be told they have to leave, and “End of the Line” teams that include police officers will be forcing them to do so. Those patrols will begin on the A,E,1,2 N and R lines, according to NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell, who added an additional 1,000 police officers are already on patrol throughout the system each day.</p><p>NYPD officers will have a direct mandate to enforce rules against lying down, sleeping, or outstretching, spitting or littering, aggressive behavior towards riders, smoking or open drug use, according to the new plan.</p>",

We cannot more strongly condemn today’s plan and the dehumanizing rhetoric that accompanied it.”</p><p>Dean pointed to the 2020 Hope Count that reflected months of overnight subway closures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic where homeless people were made to leave the subways. While fewer New Yorkers were counted on the subways that year, more were found living outside on the streets.</p><p>Advocates also raised concerns about the plan&#x27;s proposed expansion of the <a href=\"https://omh.ny.gov/omhweb/kendra_web/khome.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kendra&#x27;s Law,</a> a state statute on the books since 1999 that allows courts to force people into psychiatric treatment.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said Ma was targeted “for no other reason than his race.”</p><p>Hate crimes against Asian New Yorkers surged last year, <a href=\"https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjg1NWI3YjgtYzkzOS00Nzc0LTkwMDAtNTgzM2I2M2JmYWE1IiwidCI6IjJiOWY1N2ViLTc4ZDEtNDZmYi1iZTgzLWEyYWZkZDdjNjA0MyJ9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to NYPD data.</a> There were 131 reports of anti-Asian hate crimes, up from 28 the year before.</p><p>The violence has left Chinatown reeling, and local activists pushing back.</p><p>“We already have five shelters, and the city is dumping three more,” Jacky Wong, a member of Concerned Citizens of East Broadway, said after the vigil. “They&#x27;re really taking advantage of people of color.”</p><p>He added: “We are not blaming them but the reality is we are high risk.”</p><p>Assamad Nash, 25, was arrested in connection to Lee’s killing and charged with murder, burglary, and sexually motivated burglary. “I didn’t kill anyone,” he said while being led from the Fifth Precinct station house in Chinatown Monday afternoon, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/nyregion/suspect-christina-yuna-lee-murder.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> reported. “I don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p>The authorities said he <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/new-york/manhattan/chinatown-murder-suspect-on-streets-three-different-criminal-cases/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has a history of misdemeanor arrests</a>, and was out on supervised release following January arrests for criminal mischief and escape, adding to an ongoing debate about whether bail reforms enacted by the Legislature pose a threat to public safety.</p><p>Police said he had stayed at a nearby homeless shelter – fueling community concern over new shelters planned for the community. But Chinatown residents have hardly been of a single mind on the issue of shelters.</p><p>Last month, Community Board 3 <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/chinatown-cannot-turn-into-a-shelter-town-lunar-new-year-celebration-doubles-as-pep-rally-to-block-proposed-shelter\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voted overwhelmingly</a> in support of a plan to convert a hotel at 91 East Broadway into a 120-bed Safe Haven Shelter, in response to the killing of four homeless men on the streets of the neighborhood in 2019. But community activists say the plans for shelters come on top of another major burden – plans for a new jail.</p><p>Jan Lee, a member of <a href=\"https://www.nubcnyc.com/about-nubc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Neighbors United Below Canal</a>, said Christina Lee’s death had both terrified and galvanized the community against the jail project, seen as part of a series of connected worries.</p><p>Indeed, many of those who attended the vigil honoring Christina Lee [no relation to Jan Lee] have also been involved in efforts opposing the new jail at 125 White St., where construction is said to soon begin.</p><p>“People are hyper aware of violence, of everything connected to violence and why the policies are failing,” Lee said. “They’re understanding the connection between homeless shelters and jails and violent crime and why they’re occurring, and what leads to the root cause of these things, and how structures, gigantic structures are not the solution to having safer streets. People are very aware of that connection now.”</p><p>While some community residents see the planned high-rise jail as wholly separate from the issue of anti-Asian violence, Councilmember Christopher Marte, who represents the district, sees a thread connecting the two.</p><p>“Mostly, communities of color, low-income communities just feel ignored,” he said. “And I think this eventually just builds on who’s listening to you, who’s advocating for you, who’s representing you. It does play a large part in the back of people’s minds.”</p><p>Commercial tenants of the existing jail complex have already had <a href=\"https://boweryboogie.com/2022/01/chinatown-business-vacate-ahead-of-mdc-demolition-for-high-rise-jail/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">their leases terminated</a>, in what opponents fear will be a larger pattern of business displacement from the neighborhood.</p><p>Many opponents of the jail, which is tied to the planned closure of the jail at Rikers Island, are pinning their hopes on Mayor Eric Adams. As a candidate, Adams stood with Lee and Marte and voiced his opposition to the jail.</p><p>“I join you today in saying no new jail. No building up a jail in this location,” Adams<a href=\"http://tribecatrib.com/content/adams-said-hes-against-chinatown-jail-plans-foes-are-holding-him-it\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> said in October</a>. “We can do a better job and I know it’s possible to solve the problems we are facing with incarceration without the destruction of communities.”</p><p>Adams&#x27; position was less clear in a new statement to Gothamist released by the mayor’s office.</p><p>“Before the new administration took over, the city began to move forward with plans for a Manhattan Detention Complex site as part of its commitment to closing the jails on Rikers Island by 2027,” spokesperson Fabien Levy said. “As supported by advocates across the city, four new, smaller, more modern facilities close to courts and communities were to be built across the boroughs. The city will continue to meet with communities, hear their concerns, and incorporate their feedback into on-going plans as we continue to move this critical process forward and finally close down Rikers once and for all.”</p><p>Marte said he plans to meet with Adams this week, still hoping to halt the project.</p>",

The killing has not been ruled a hate crime, though it follows a spate of violent attacks on the city’s Asian-American community and a dramatic spike in Asian-related hate crimes since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Police said they responded to a 911 call early Sunday morning and found the suspect barricaded inside the apartment. On gaining entry, police said they found the victim, Christina Yuna Lee “in the bathroom with trauma about the body.” She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Police said Nash lived on the Bowery, only blocks away from where the stabbing took place.</p><p>News of the attack brought an outpouring of alarm and condolences from political and community leaders throughout the state. A rally was scheduled for Monday morning to call out violence against the Asian-American community.</p><p>On Sunday Mayor Eric Adams called the incident &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1492947662668185600\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the definition of horrific</a>,&quot; and in a statement he released on Sunday, said New Yorkers were mourning the woman and would &quot;stand with our Asian brothers and sisters.&quot; He added that even though the suspect is in custody, &quot;the conditions that created him remain.&quot;</p>",

Zapantis, according to the report, had been inside the basement dressed in &quot;gladiator attire, including a helmet, shield, and sword.&quot; He had no gun, the report read.</p><p>As the Emergency Services Unit was called, officers on scene tried to tell Zapantis, who Vomvolakis said was suffering from bipolar disorder, to calm down as they kept him from exiting the basement. According to the report, Zapantis broke through his basement door and &quot;engaged the officers.&quot; After a struggle, officers stunned Zapantis three times, rendering him unresponsive. He was rushed to a local hospital and pronounced dead just under an hour later. The Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office found Zapantis died of cardiac arrest due to dilated cardiomyopathy during the struggle with police, including being hit with a Taser.</p><p>Investigators said officers were justified in their use of a Taser, pointing to state law that clears officers if they prove their actions involving physical force were justified. Zapantis was described by officers as over six feet tall and weighed more than 300 pounds.</p><p>Vomvolakis called the findings disappointing, adding that the family has since filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the NYPD, seeking damages.</p><p>Investigators at James&#x27; office have not recommended further training of police officers, but clarification on the NYPD&#x27;s annual use of force report detailing whether the NYPD&#x27;s Taser use resulted in civilian death. The most recent publicly available <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/firearms-discharge.page\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report on the use of force</a> by the NYPD shows the police used stun guns 1,271 times in 2019.</p><p>&quot;Their findings and ultimate decision will do absolutely nothing to promote change in the way the police handle calls involving mentally ill people,&quot; Vomvolakis said.</p>",

The original memo included a list of low-level criminal charges Bragg’s office would no longer prosecute — adding that prosecutors should seek prison time as a last resort and stating a commitment to reducing pre-trial detention.</p><p>One policy Bragg definitively walked back was how certain robbery charges were prosecuted.</p><p>Under the original memo, Bragg had instructed prosecutors to charge certain cases involving a weapon as a misdemeanor petit larceny, “if the force or threat of force consists of displaying a dangerous instrument or similar behavior but does not create a genuine risk of physical harm.”</p><p>These types of cases often involve homeless individuals stealing household items and later being arrested and found with a screwdriver or pocket knife,<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/confusion-backlash-and-optimism-manhattan-da-alvin-bragg-attempts-break-status-quo%26utm_medium=social%26utm_source=twitter%26utm_campaign=shared_twitter?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=shared_twitter\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> public defenders explained.</a> Under former Manhattan DA Cy Vance, such cases were pursued as felony robbery cases where defendants face a minimum of five years in prison, but Bragg had promised to downgrade them.</p><p>He reverted back to the office’s original position Friday in the latest memo saying, “commercial robbery at knifepoint, or by other weapon that creates a risk of physical harm, will be charged as a felony.”</p><p>The memo also walked back a promise to halt prosecutions of “resisting arrest,” which had drawn ire from police unions.</p><p>“Violence against police officers will not be tolerated,” Bragg’s Friday memo stated.</p><p>Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for the DA clarified certain resisting arrest charges would be allowed in cases where people were charged with other misdemeanors and felony cases — not just felony cases, as had been previously stated.</p><p>Bragg also clarified his stance on gun prosecutions saying, “the default in gun cases is a felony prosecution,” though a spokesperson clarified that the office wouldn’t always seek prison time for those charges, as the office had previously promised. Bragg had not said he would not prosecute gun possession as a felony in his original memo, though critics had accused him of being lenient on gun crimes more generally.</p><p>Bragg had been under fire for a month following a rocky <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/bragg-admits-he-botched-policy-rollout-stands-controversial-memo\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rollout of his initial memo released in early January.</a> He admitted he could have presented the policies more clearly and had been on the defensive for weeks, attempting to explain his approach amid a barrage of criticism.</p><p>The initial policy changes drew immediate ire from tabloids, police unions, candidates for governor and eventually, Hochul, who has the power to remove Bragg from office. The pressure on Bragg escalated after the killings of police officers Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora.

You can count on me to be a partner in that effort.&quot;</p><p>The event was a display of unity among city, state, and federal officials around the precipitous rise in gun violence across major U.S. cities, which could likely be a factor in the midterm elections.</p><p>But success in stopping the flow of illegal guns has eluded Democrats for decades. Most of the guns seized by the NYPD have been traced back to states with looser gun laws and attempts to pass gun control measures in Congress have perennially failed.</p><p>Flanked by Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, Biden held up New York City as a model for its strategic partnerships with federal, state and local officials. He said that he wanted to help “every major city follow New York’s lead.”</p><p>The visit underscores the growing relationship between Biden and Adams, which <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/just-two-blue-collar-guys-why-biden-adams-are-counting-on-a-mutually-beneficial-relationship\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">could be mutually beneficial</a>. On Thursday, Adams recalled his exchange with Biden during his recent visit to the White House.</p><p>“He grabbed me by my arm and turned me around and looked into my eyes, and he says, ‘Eric, what can we do?’” the mayor said.</p><p>Before the gathering, the White House announced expanded measures under the U.S. Department of Justice to combat the rise in violent crime across the country. They include increasing resources for a task force focused on cracking down on the so-called “Iron Pipeline,” the illegal gun trade that traffics firearms from the south to states along the eastern seaboard; providing training for prosecutors on bringing cases against those who sell ghost guns, which are firearms assembled from kits; and prioritizing federal prosecutions of individuals who illegally sell or transfer guns used in violent crimes.</p><p>Biden also said he would direct $200 million toward community intervention programs through his proposed budget and called on Congress to add $300 million in federal grants for law enforcement agencies. States can currently use some of the $350 billion in stimulus funding to hire more police, Biden said.</p><p>The president has tried to tamp down criticism over the support by some members of his party for the “defund the police” movement and embraced Adams’s call for a balance between policing and investment in low-income communities and intervention programs.</p><p>“Look, as I said, we&#x27;re not about defunding,” Biden said. “We&#x27;re about funding and providing the additional services you need, beyond someone with a gun strapped to their shoulder.”</p><p>Other Democrats have also spoken out against calls to reduce police funding. Earlier in the day, Bronx Rep. Ritchie Torres told MSNBC, &quot;The defund police movement is dead in New York City.”</p><p>“Good riddance,” he added.</p>",

Before the event began, Biden motioned to Sumit Sulan, the 27-year-old NYPD officer who participated in the response to a domestic violence dispute that killed his fellow officers. Police said Sulan, a rookie, fired the shots that killed the alleged gunman, LaShawn McNeil, and was later hailed as a hero. The president then led a standing ovation.</p><p>Since winning the primary, Adams has basked in the national spotlight. He has sought to frame his blue-collar background and more centrist positions on public safety as the future of the Democratic Party.</p><p>But after a spate of violent incidents, the mayor has been under increasing pressure to deliver on his campaign promise of improving public safety. Last month, he announced a plan that called for a range of approaches — from bringing back a plainclothes unit of police officers, to investing in summer jobs.</p><p>Adams said he asked the president to visit New York City so as to mount a response to gun violence similar to the way federal officials rallied around the city in the aftermath of 9/11.</p><p>He said he also invited Biden to see up close one of the city’s violence intervention programs. Following the meeting at police headquarters, Biden and Adams were headed to a public school near the Queensbridge Houses —  a public housing complex in Long Island City where the introduction of a Cure Violence program was followed by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/nyregion/six-blocks-96-buildings-zero-shootings-new-recipe-at-the-queensbridge-houses.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a year without any shootings</a>.</p><p>Hochul, a Democrat who is running for her first full term, praised Biden for making the visit and touted the cooperation between herself and Adams as well as other elected officials. Late last month, the governor formed an interstate task force on illegal guns that brings together law enforcement officials from nine states in the Northeast.</p><p>“For the first time in my life, I&#x27;m seeing a unification of purpose that has been missing,” Hochul said.</p><p>Nonetheless, many Democrats have cautioned against leaning on excessive policing to bring down crime. Rep. Nydia Velázquez of Brooklyn, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who joined the event, urged the president to focus on tackling the root causes of crime.</p><p>“We know what works and what doesn’t work,” she said. “We must recognize that mobilizing community-based resources, job opportunities, and early intervention are key to protecting our youth from gun violence.”</p>",

Mora was shot and killed in the line of duty last month along with Jason Rivera, whose funeral was last week.</p><p>Speaking in Spanish before thousands of mourners, Mora’s older sister Karina Mora described her little brother’s contagious smile.</p><p>“It didn’t matter how tired he was coming home from work, he lit up the house with his smile,” she said. “Today that light goes out, with pain, forever.”</p><p>She recalled the fear with which she watched her little brother growing up in East Harlem, afraid he wouldn’t make it to adulthood. She said she felt an enormous sense of relief when he graduated from the police academy in 2018.</p><p>“I felt an infinite peace to know that my little brother wasn’t lost in the streets of New York,” she said. “I never imagined that my peace would last less than four years.”</p><p>Mora, 27, succumbed to his injuries <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/second-officer-harlem-shooting-dies-police-say\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on January 25th,</a> four days after he was shot while responding to a <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/two-officers-shot-harlem-reports-fatalities\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">911 call for help from a mother calling about her adult son LaShawn McNeil</a>.

McNeil was also pronounced dead on Monday.</p><p>In a note to staff, John Jay Professor Irina Zakirova recalled teaching Mora’s capstone class in 2018, the same year he joined the NYPD. She described him as a “curious and passionate student with a great personality,” who wrote his final paper on the effects of Stop and Frisk and community policing in New York City.</p><p>Gov.

Past attempts to raise the cap on the number of street vendor licenses in New York were met with fierce backlash from brick-and-mortar businesses who felt the vendors were cutting into their bottom line. Meanwhile, license owners, similar to the taxi medallion business, were charging operators exorbitant rates to operate under their permits.</p><p>Attia, of the Street Vendor Project, said the city’s ongoing regulation goes against the spirit of the city’s policy change. The former mayor had <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/07/871746452/de-blasio-promises-cuts-to-nypd-ends-nyc-curfew\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced plans to remove police from vendor enforcement at the height of the Black Lives Matters protests in summer 2020</a>. That followed photos and videos emerging in 2019 of police handcuffing Latina women selling churros in the subways, seizing their goods and <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-arrests-another-subway-churro-vendor-inflaming-outrage-over-cuomos-quality-life-crackdown\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hauling them off in tears</a>.</p><p>“For so many people of color, for so many immigrants, street vending is their opportunity to move forward,” de Blasio said in 2020. “They should not have to engage the NYPD as they’re trying to make their livelihood.”</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams’ office has not responded to a request for comment, despite the mayor recently singing the praises of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1483413899135365124?s=20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his local fruit stand</a>.</p><p>When asked about officers’ interactions with street vendors, NYPD spokesperson Sergeant Edward Riley said, “the NYPD maintains its authority over safety issues such as blocking pedestrian traffic, operating too close to building or subway entrances and, as reflected in the small number of summonses issued, officers use a high level of discretion.”</p><p>The number of NYPD tickets for vendors during the first three quarters of 2021 decreased by 8.5 percent, compared to the same period the year before — and by 71 percent since 2019. But, the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection conducted more than 6,000 of its own inspections and issued 762 tickets to street vendors last year. In all, vendors received more than 1,187 tickets last year, not including NYPD summonses over the winter. They received 540 of those tickets between July and September last year, compared to 525 during the same period in 2019.</p><p>Irene Arizaga, who sells <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/488774802\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chuzos (a tybe of kebab) alongside other street vendors on Roosevelt Avenue and Junction Boulevard</a> in Corona, Queens, said that while she has noticed fewer police sweeps on the commercial strip, DWCP inspections have hurt vendors at a time when they are struggling to recover from the pandemic.</p><p>She said civilian inspectors visited the area four times in the first week of January, forcing her to stop working. “They tell us, ‘We’ll give you 10 minutes and if you’re not gone, then tickets,” she said, adding that the prospect of their visits keeps her on edge every day. “So we have to pack up everything as fast as possible to avoid a ticket, and we leave.”</p><p>She also said that replacing police with the DWCP doesn’t address the restrictive vending regulations she believes are the root of the problem. She’s one of thousands of street vendors across the five boroughs working without a required license because the city capped the number of licenses at 2,900 for decades. Selling without a license, and vending in prohibited areas like the subway, were the two main types of vendor violations cited by both the NYPD and the DCWP last year. A new law <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/food/nyc-street-food-vendors-eagerly-anticipate-city-expansion-permits\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">signed last year</a> will gradually create more licenses over the next ten years, but <a href=\"https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3686667&amp;GUID=A0683818-66E6-4651-8B31-3D65EE4D61B1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the first round won’t be available until this summer</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, advocates for vendors say they are continuing to ask the DCWP and the Adams administration to do more to educate vendors on regulations, rather than penalize them.</p><p>Arizaga said she hopes the city will do more to reform its regulations and support local vendors, who are essential workers.</p><p>“We are part of the city’s economy,” she said. “We supplied all the needs of New York and its people during the pandemic. We stayed in the streets serving the public.”</p><p><i>With translation assistance from Christian Herrera.</i></p>",

The toll has been disproportionately felt by low-wage workers, who are predominantly people of color, and exacerbated a sense of inequality, he added.</p><p>“The economy and workers have changed in so many ways,” he said. “We can&#x27;t have a policy that just leaves it to the labor market to heal itself.”</p><p>Covid has been also blamed for giving way to multiple social crises, from an increase in the number of New Yorkers living on the street and a rise in mental health issues.</p><p>Hate crimes are also up, especially among Asian Americans. Although police have said there were no signs that Michelle Alyssa Go, the woman pushed to her death on the subway last Saturday, was targeted because of her ethnicity, the attack rattled the Asian American community.</p><p>“I know people are really scared, people in the Asian American community, and many New Yorkers,” said U.S. Rep. Grace Meng of Queens during the vigil ceremony on Tuesday.</p><p>So far, Adams has ordered more police officers to be deployed to the subways as part of a plan with the state. The joint plan includes dispatching mental health professionals into the system. But <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/hochuls-promised-plan-for-homeless-outreach-in-the-subway-hasnt-left-the-station\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hirings have yet to begin</a>. On Friday the state released requests for proposals for community groups to respond.</p><p>Gun violence has abated in some neighborhoods but persisted in the Bronx and parts of northern Manhattan, where earlier this month a 19-year-old woman working at Burger King in East Harlem was fatally shot during a robbery.</p><p>In 2021, gun arrests citywide were up 6% over the prior year and 34% compared to 2019, according to crime figures. However, shootings have soared in other major U.S. cities, suggesting a national trend related to the pandemic.</p><p>The gun used by the Harlem shooter was a Glock with an additional magazine capable of firing upwards of 40 additional rounds. It had been reported stolen in 2017 from Baltimore, police said.</p><p>“Adams has to start thinking about how to disrupt the supply of guns to the street,” said Jeffrey Fagan, a Columbia Law School professor who studies policing. “We can&#x27;t arrest our way to safety any more than we could arrest our way out of a drug epidemic.”</p><p>The situation stands to worsen in the spring, he added, when the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/us-supreme-court-mulls-overturning-new-yorks-concealed-carry-gun-law\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a ruling</a> that would make it easier for people to carry guns in public.</p><p>Gun laws in New York City are among the strictest in the country. With only a few exceptions, a city resident who possesses a firearm must have a license issued by the NYPD, which can take over a year to obtain and is often granted only under the most stringent of circumstances.</p>",

                            "value": "<p>The Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, has attributed 70% of guns seized to coming from southern states that have looser gun buying restrictions. However, some law enforcement members have <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/22/why-the-feds-cant-stop-nyc-shootings-with-illegal-gun-crackdown/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> that illegal guns circulate for years in the city and that crackdowns on smuggling have limited impact.</p><p>Although the recent spike has alarmed experts, the current level of crime in New York City is nowhere near the highpoint of 1990, when there were more than 2,200 murders. Citywide, there 488 murders last year.</p><p>Mayors have generally responded to crime by increasing police. During the early 1990s, David Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor, secured additional funding from Albany to increase the city’s NYPD ranks to reduce crime. The move was later credited with initiating a decline in the crime rate. Crime levels plummeted under Giuliani, a two-term mayor who oversaw a crackdown on low-level offenses as well as the development of CompStat, a database system that tracks crime statistics trends.</p><p>But many people have since recognized that the drive to bring crime down had negative consequences, including a high number of people who were sent to jail for misdemeanors and the excessive use of stop-and-frisk tactics that revealed racist policing patterns. Stop-and-frisk exploded under Giuliani’s successor, Michael Bloomberg, creating a chasm that further divided minority communities and the NYPD.</p><p>Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ran on a campaign of ending stop and frisk, saw crime fall to historic lows under his tenure, although it will also be remembered for the fatal police chokehold that killed Eric Garner, who officers were trying to arrest for selling loose cigarettes.</p><p>Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said Adams needs to strike a balance. “We need to remain very focused on driving down violent crime,” he said. &quot;We also need to understand that while we need to respond to nonviolent crime misdemeanors, accountability does not have to equal jail, but a lack of accountability can equal lawlessness.”</p><p>Aborn said he believes Adams, who he has known for more than two decades, can bridge two different eras of policing. While the mayor needs to get ahead of the crisis, he said, “I would rather see a well-thought-out plan, than a plan rushed to fill the moment.”</p><p>Adams has so far not indicated that he will expand the city’s police force, which has an <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/omb/downloads/pdf/adopt21-fp.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">operating budget of $5.4 billion</a>. He has instead said he wants to make the NYPD more efficient as well as take a holistic approach to crime that involves investment in communities of color. He’s also leaning on the federal government for support, lobbying for more gun restrictions and urging Congress to pass the now stalled $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Act. If passed, funds would be earmarked to states with cure violence programs, such as those found in New York City.</p><p>At the same time, the mayor has embraced approaches unpopular with progressive Democrats. He has said stop-and-frisk, which he opposed as a police officer, can be fairly implemented with better training and says he will reinstate a controversial plainclothes unit targeting gun violence. He has also called on state lawmakers to revisit bail reform, which eliminates bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.</p><p>Adams has insisted that he wants to balance public safety with justice.</p><p>“I’m the right person for this moment,” he told reporters at a news briefing Saturday.</p><p>He later attended another vigil outside Manhattan’s 32nd Precinct for the fallen officer, Jason Rivera, a 22-year-old Inwood native, and his critically injured partner, Wilbert Mora.</p><p></p>",

One mother stood with her two bundled children in two, one nestled by her waist and another in a stroller.

And how much worse can it get?” he said. “If you&#x27;re willing to shoot out a cop then my life means absolutely nothing. You would shoot a citizen just, you know, point blank.”</p><p>That type of surveillance in New York was roundly criticized for disproportionately targeting Black and brown residents, the vast majority of whom were innocent of any crimes. Defenders of the practice argue that crime decreased while it was an allowed practice, although studies have shown that this may have been due to more to additional police resources in high-crime areas. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that NYPD&#x27;s use of stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional.</p>",

But Lander’s report found that police offered conflicting information about their progress on the hiring and it’s not clear how much money the NYPD might have saved in the process.</p><p>“Paying uniformed, armed police officers to perform administrative duties that could be handled by civilian employees wastes resources that could be better utilized to improve community safety for New Yorkers,” <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/new-york-city-comptrollers-office-audit-finds-nypd-fell-behind-on-civilianization-goals/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lander wrote in a statement along with the audit.</a> “I urge the Department to take a hard look at the findings of this audit and accelerate the civilianization process to make better use of our public safety resources.”</p><p>It’s the first audit published since Lander assumed the role of New York City Comptroller on Jan. 1, though the report was completed by staffers under Scott Stringer, the office’s former head. As a City Council member, Lander was a vocal proponent of defunding the police in the wake of George Floyd&#x27;s murder and the protests that ensued on New York City streets.</p><p>In a response to the audit sent to his office, the NYPD took issue with the methodology and findings and denied a claim made in the audit that the department was not keeping adequate records around civilian recruiting.</p><p>“The Comptroller’s office failed to understand that the initiative was not a straight one of one replacement of officers with civilians but rather shifting specific responsibility that could be carried out by their civilian counterparts,” NYPD officials told the Comptroller’s office.</p><p>NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information John Miller said Friday that the department was still waiting for approval from City Hall to make additional civilian hires — something he said was communicated to Lander&#x27;s office.</p><p>&quot;The Department has continued to request resources for additional civilianization, but the request has not yet been funded by OMB due to budget constraints,&quot; Miller said in a statement. &quot;Until funding and headcount are authorized for additional civilianization positions, NYPD cannot proceed.&quot;</p><p>He also said the process for hiring &quot;involves many steps, including extensive candidate review and background investigations,&quot; but added, &quot;Whenever feasible, every effort has been made to fill civilian positions as quickly as possible while ensuring due diligence and working within the requirements of the city hiring process.&quot;</p><p>The comptroller’s audit tried to ascertain how many civilian employees had been brought on to the agency between 2015 and 2019. But reports the NYPD sent to the City Council conflicted with ones it provided to the Comptroller. Various sets of data the NYPD sent to the comptroller’s office also appeared to conflict with each other, the audit found. In one set of numbers the NYPD provided, the agency claimed it had brought on 591 civilian employees during that period — in another, the agency said it had only hired 289 civilians.</p><p>When the comptroller’s office asked the NYPD for underlying records to verify its claims, they were stonewalled, according to the report.</p><p>“The NYPD was minimally responsive to our requests, eventually citing potential difficulties and security concerns the agency anticipated it would face,” the report reads. “We were unable to estimate the savings that the NYPD had achieved, could have achieved and could potentially achieve in the future through civilianization efforts.”</p><p>The comptroller’s office took issue with the agency referencing security concerns.</p><p>“The NYPD does not indicate the nature of the purported security risk so we were unable to assess the veracity of its claim,” the report said. “Consequently we find that the NYPD’s argument has no merit.”</p><p>For decades, <a href=\"https://cbcny.org/research/overboard-ot\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uniformed officers who earn an average of more than $100,000</a> a year after overtime and bonuses, have done tasks within the agency that could just as easily be done by civilians at a much lower cost to taxpayers ; such as secretarial, administrative or public relations duties. Including overtime pay, civilians made around $50,700 less a year than uniformed officers, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office.</p><p>Budget watchdogs have long argued that bringing on more civilian employees would free up uniformed officers for crime fighting responsibilities, and thus lead to lower costs in overtime for uniformed officers. <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/police-overtime-spending-is-down-this-year-how-far-down-and-is-it-expected-to-stay-below-past-years-nycbtn-june-2021.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The NYPD for years</a>, has blown through the overtime budget allotted by the city. In 2020, the agency spent more than $<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-likely-blow-overtime-budget-least-162-million-independent-report-says\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">800 million just on overtime</a>; less than the entire budget of the <a href=\"https://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/DPR-Fact-sheet.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Parks Department.</a></p><p>The city lost an approximate $24.4 million a year because the NYPD had police officers working administrative jobs, according to a 2002 <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/follow-up-audit-report-on-the-opportunities/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">audit from the City Comptroller.</a> But the NYPD’s efforts to address the issue have consistently fallen behind schedule.</p><p>An Independent <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/police-departments-civilian-hiring-lags-behind-stated-plans-march-2017.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Budget Office review from 2016 found</a> that, in the three prior years, the NYPD had been allotted funding to bring on 1,668 civilian employees but only hired 284. Through last fiscal year, the NYPD employed 34,858 uniformed personnel and 15,638 civilians, <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/mmr2021/2021_mmr.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the annual Mayor’s Management report.</a></p><p>It’s also an issue that current Mayor Eric Adams campaigned on tackling. One of his campaign pledges was to save an estimated $500 million in NYPD spending by recruiting more <a href=\"https://ericadams2021.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EricAdams2021_100Step_Plan.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">civilians to do administrative work</a>. Adams, a former NYPD captain, railed about the issue as recently as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayorsOffice/status/1483878801935413253?s=20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wednesday, during a press conference at City Hall.</a></p><p>“There are too many police officers inside these agencies that are just there. They&#x27;re not on modified assignments,” he said. “They’re just assigned to do non-law enforcement. That just makes no sense for taxpayers.”</p><p>His office didn’t immediately return a request for further comment. A spokesperson for the Sergeants Benevolent Association likewise didn’t respond to inquiries.</p><p>PBA President Patrick Lynch said there were “plenty of common-sense ways to eliminate waste and inefficiency.” The union cited vendor contracts, outside consultants and top-heavy management structures as among the areas the department could examine for cost savings.</p><p>“What we can’t have is a ‘stealth defunding’ under the guise of civilianization that undermines NYPD operations and our public safety mission,” Lynch said. “Nor can we afford any further reduction in overall uniformed headcount in the middle of this public safety crisis.”</p><p><i>This story has been updated with additional information from the NYPD and the PBA.</i></p>",

The driver was arrested and charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to use due care. The city notes that half of the traffic fatalities in the five boroughs take place at intersections. </p><p>Last year, New York City had the <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/grading-de-blasio-mayor-praised-for-launching-vision-zero-but-critics-say-he-didnt-go-far-enough\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highest number of traffic fatalities</a> since 2013, when 279 people were killed by vehicles.</p><p>“No matter how much we lean into Vision Zero, that vision was clouded by the number of deaths we witnessed in our city,” Adams said Wednesday in Brooklyn, joined by Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell, and safe streets advocates. They stood at the intersection of Caton Avenue and Coney Island Avenue, with the mayor pointing out that 26 people have been injured there in traffic incidents, while there have been five deaths along Coney Island Avenue.</p><p>Adams plans to go to the Vision Zero toolkit by installing 100 raised pedestrian crossings that make crossings more visible and slow drivers down. He also wants to put 100 bike corrals at intersections and remove parking places where large vehicles can make it difficult for pedestrians to see oncoming traffic and for vehicles to see pedestrian crossings. The goal of improving 1,000 intersections is for 2022, according to a DOT spokesperson.</p><p>The mayor, a former transit cop and then police captain, also plans to deploy the NYPD to increase enforcement of drivers and cyclists who fail to yield to pedestrians.  </p><p>While he said he wants to “double down on enforcement,” it’s unclear if Adams means to double the number of officers assigned to watch traffic, or double the number of tickets being issued for violating the law. The NYPD and the Department of Transportation didn’t respond to requests for clarification.</p><p>“As we take a new approach to Vision Zero, we know intersections are where pedestrians and cyclists face the greatest dangers — and so we can and will make hundreds of crosswalks safer with a range of treatments, both new ones and more of those that we know work,” said Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. “We will not be complacent or accept any life lost on our streets.” </p><p>Former Mayor Bill de Blasio, <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/grading-de-blasio-mayor-praised-for-launching-vision-zero-but-critics-say-he-didnt-go-far-enough\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who vowed to reduce traffic deaths</a>, completed 811 street design changes during his eight years as mayor. </p><p>“Investment in safe street design is how we will achieve Vision Zero,” Danny Harris, Executive Director of Transportation Alternatives, wrote in a statement. “The concrete solutions announced today will better prevent drivers from speeding and protect our most vulnerable road users, like seniors, children, and everyone who bikes.”</p><p><i>This article has been updated to reflect that the 1,000 intersection improvements would be for 2022.</i></p>",

                            "value": "<p>But two weeks in, the new mayor is still just getting his sea legs at the helm of a vast bureaucracy. As Brooklyn borough president, Adams oversaw a staff of roughly 60 people. As mayor, he is executive-in-chief in charge of around 400,000 municipal employees. And while many of his administration picks have been hailed by political observers, some have fallen under a cloud of controversy.</p><p>Adams says he’s not deterred.</p><p>He said he spent nearly a year before becoming the city’s second Black mayor reading about different types of leaders, from politics to the armed services to professional sports coaches. Likening his role to a pilot monitoring a dashboard, he has suggested he would take a more hands-off approach to managing his senior staff.</p><p>“Once I recruited people who were emotionally intelligent, who were sound, who knew how to handle conflict,” he said, “I can just give them the mission and they are carrying it out.”</p><p>Still, the job has bedeviled many of his predecessors. Adams comes into it amid an unprecedented crisis in the pandemic, where policies on testing and vaccination need to be rolled out swiftly and effectively to nearly 9 million New Yorkers.</p><p>He is also facing ethical concerns. In his first week, his decision to reportedly hire his younger brother Bernard Adams as deputy police commissioner and appoint <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/adams-appoints-philip-banks-deputy-mayor-public-safety\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Banks III</a> as deputy mayor drew accusations of nepotism and cronyism. Banks, a longtime friend of Adams, is a former police chief who was named an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal corruption investigation.</p><p>The controversy has prompted the mayor to pull back on at least one decision. On Wednesday, a City Hall official confirmed Bernard Adams would be appointed as executive director of mayoral security at a salary of $210,000 – not deputy police commissioner as initially reported by multiple outlets. He will manage approximately 40 people. The downgrade was first <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/nyregion/bernard-adams-brother-mayor.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> by the New York Times.</p><p>“You really need a managerial system,” said John Mollenkopf, a political scientist at CUNY, but added that no matter the model, a mayor must also focus on fostering a good dynamic among cabinet members, each of whom will bring their own set of expertise and viewpoints.</p><p>“The team has to be cohesive,” Mollenkopf said. “It has to be able to make decisions.”</p><p><b>The ‘Eric Adams’ System</b></p><p>Although not every New Yorker may have agreed with his policies, Michael Bloomberg, who served from 2002 to 2013, is often invoked as the mayor who showed that City Hall could be managed. The billionaire founder of a financial information company introduced an unprecedented governing style that evoked Wall Street trading floors and placed him at the center of an open maze of around 50 cubicles.</p><p>Those who worked for Bloomberg say the decision to sit in a bullpen made him both more visible and accessible. Not only did he himself hold his meetings inside the bullpen, his deputy mayors were expected to do the same. The arrangement was also credited for imposing a high level of accountability.</p><p>Stu Loeser, who worked as Bloomberg’s press secretary, recalled that Shaun Donovan, then the city’s housing commissioner under Bloomberg, never entered City Hall without committing to memory the most updated tally of how many affordable housing units the city had built or preserved.</p><p>“Because he knew that there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;s gonna run into Mike,” he said. “And Mike&#x27;s going to say, ‘What&#x27;s the number? How are we doing? Are we doing fast? Are we doing slower? What are the complications?’”</p><p>Bloomberg, a notorious workaholic, was typically at City Hall by 7:15 a.m., Loeser said. There was a standing 9 a.m. staff meeting at either Gracie Mansion or City Hall.</p><p>A City Hall spokesman said that the time Adams reports to the office is variable, depending on whether he has a morning event scheduled. He says the mayor is usually in bed by 1 a.m. and rises by 5 or 6 a.m.</p><p>Adams said he believes in accessibility but he does not demand frequent one-on-one updates from his staff.</p><p>“I&#x27;m a big Google Docs person,” he said.</p><p>He added that as borough president, he used Google Docs to track meetings, staff changes as well as budget and other data.</p><p>“I can see where I need to interfere because we&#x27;re not trending in the right direction or something is not being fulfilled,” he said. “So I don&#x27;t have to have the physical face-to-face because those documents tell me when I need to call someone.”</p><p>His predecessor, Bill de Blasio, by contrast, was known for micromanaging and preferring <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-mayors-style-vexes-some-aides-1441156711\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">late-night meetings and phone calls</a>. He often carried a ringed binder to his press conferences along with a series of index cards.</p><p>Adams, who said he meditates every morning, is also big on mindfulness. He said he recently began a Zoom meeting involving a “stressful situation” by making everyone do breathing exercises.</p><p>“In City Hall, everyone is learning the Eric Adams system,” Adams said.</p><p><b>Slow Appointment Process</b></p><p>But the job of New York City mayor is the antithesis of zen, a constant churn of crises. And by most estimates, Adams is behind on filling out his administration. Nearly two weeks into office, he has appointed just over two dozen people to key roles of advisers, deputies and commissioners. He has yet to announce picks for more than 80 positions, including the critical roles of sanitation and fire commissioners, which are currently being occupied by holdovers from the previous administration.</p><p>The pace has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/nyregion/for-de-blasio-so-many-jobs-to-fill-so-little-time.html?searchResultPosition=6\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">similar</a> to de Blasio, who was often criticized for slow and deliberate decision making. Bloomberg, along with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, took the speediest approach to hirings, appointing roughly 30 members of their administrations by their first inaugurations, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/nyregion/for-de-blasio-so-many-jobs-to-fill-so-little-time.html?searchResultPosition=6\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p><p>Adams’s choices for top members of his cabinet have received both praise and scrutiny.

He offered up Grillo as an example, pointing out her work leading the School Construction Authority to build over 80,000 K-12 seats and over 9,000 pre-K seats.</p><p>“They have been at the forefront of changing things to make government work better,” he said.</p><p><b>‘Trumpian’ Choices?</b></p><p>The picks of Bernard Adams and Philip Banks III have raised serious ethical concerns among experts.</p><p>Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University, described the pair of appointments as “Trumpian,” referring to former President Donald Trump who employed members of his family, including his daughter and son-in-law, to key positions in the White House.</p><p>“You&#x27;re literally hiring your brother, and what amounts to one of your dearest friends,” she said.</p><p>Greer argued that aside from Banks’s involvement in a corruption scandal, his selection is also troubling because it threatens to undermine Sewell, a former Nassau County chief of detectives who grew up in Queens but has never worked in the NYPD. As deputy mayor for public safety, Banks would oversee and coordinate public safety policies by all city agencies.</p><p>“On the one hand, you’re championing this African-American woman that you&#x27;ve appointed for police commissioner,” she said, referencing Sewell who is Black. “But are you handicapping her in her ability to do her job by putting in all these other NYPD personnel who have deeper connections and knowledge of how the department is run?”</p><p>The mayor, who has promised to prioritize public safety, has <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/mayor-eric-adams-defends-appointing-brother-deputy-nypd-commissioner\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">defended</a> the two appointments. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he described his brother, who he said would be in charge of security for the mayor and other elected officials, as someone he trusts to protect him amid a period of increasing hate crimes and white supremacy.</p><p>Policing and good government experts have questioned Bernard Adams’s qualifications. Although he is a retired NYPD sergeant, Bernard Adams most recently worked in the parking and transportation division at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p><p>On Wednesday, a City Hall official said Adams’s brother would in fact be hired as an executive director of mayoral security, which was first <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/nyregion/bernard-adams-brother-mayor.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> by the New York Times. Initial news reports said Bernard Adams was tapped as a deputy police commissioner. Adams’s brother will work out of 1 Police Plaza, the NYPD’s headquarters, and manage approximately 40 people, the city hall official said. The job’s salary is $210,000.</p><p>The appointment is currently undergoing a review by the Conflicts of Interest Board (COIB), according to the mayor. It is unclear what the administration would do should the request for approval be denied.</p><p>Adams has argued Banks has never been charged with a crime, and that as chief of department, he brought down crime and reined in the abuse of stop-and-frisk tactics.</p><p>Recent mayors have appointed family members to key jobs. De Blasio put his wife Chirlane McCray in charge of fundraising and mental health initiatives. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/02/nyregion/bloomberg-hires-2-relatives-and-jokes-about-layoffs.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appointed</a> his daughter, Emma, and sister Marjorie Tiven to roles in his administration. In all of those cases, though, the jobs were unpaid.</p><p>J. Phillip Thompson, a former deputy mayor under de Blasio who also worked for Mayor David Dinkins, said that he believed Banks, who was on track to becoming first deputy commissioner prior to resigning in 2014, was indeed qualified.</p><p>In the end, he argued, all mayors need to surround themselves with people they have known and trusted. And as someone who pressed for change within the NYPD, Adams knows the culture of policing needs to be changed, he said.</p><p>“I think he&#x27;s thought about this for a long time,” Thompson said. “And he&#x27;s probably thought about it with Phil Banks for a long time.”</p><p>The potential conflicts of interests, however, go beyond Banks. His brother David Banks is the city’s schools chancellor. Sheena Wright, a deputy mayor for strategic initiatives, is the chancellor’s partner.</p><p>Two other members of Adams’s inner circle have also been given jobs in the administration. He appointed Frank Carone, a close friend and prominent Brooklyn lawyer with <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-elections-government/ny-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-chief-of-staff-frank-carone-rent-dispute-chc-20220110-hzfgu72hv5gd5acbww62zrd2o4-story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">some controversial clients</a>, as his chief of staff. On Tuesday, he named Ingrid Lewis-Martin, his deputy borough president whose husband was Adams’s partner in the NYPD, as his chief adviser.</p><p><b>Political And Managerial Risks</b></p><p>From a management standpoint, Mollenkopf said appointing people with “emotional, historical and familial” connections to important positions in government is risky.</p><p>“Because you&#x27;ll have to listen to them,” he said. “They have special access, and every other commissioner and so forth will know that they have special access. And it threatens to create a sense of favoritism and a narrowing of the band of information that the mayor will get.”</p><p>New York City mayors have historically had to contend with silos and turf battles within their staff, he added. That can lead to frustrated commissioners trying to recruit support from those outside the administration or the public by leaking stories to the press.</p><p>Asked about such concerns, Adams said he is acutely aware of the tendency for infighting and jealousies within a new team.</p><p>“I did not try to ignore the fact that I was bringing in longtime advisers into an environment with new people where there&#x27;s going to be some natural tension,” he said. “We work through it and we communicate.”</p>",

The news came shortly after Philip Banks, a former top NYPD police chief with a controversial history, revealed in a Daily News op-ed that he would be the city&#x27;s <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/adams-appoints-philip-banks-deputy-mayor-public-safety\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">next deputy mayor for public safety</a>.</p><p>Mayor Adams faced criticism about both appointments, which raised questions about nepotism and cronyism. Banks resigned in 2014 after being under federal investigation for a bribery scandal. His brother, David Banks, is the new city&#x27;s school chancellor. Meanwhile, Sheena Wright, who is the latter&#x27;s domestic partner, is serving as the deputy mayor for strategic initiatives.</p><p>Asked about the selection of Banks despite a past that some experts said would prohibit him from receiving a top security clearance, Adams said Philip Banks had brought down crime and &quot;reined in&quot; the abuse of stop-and-frisk during his time as the chief of department, the highest-ranking uniformed position.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to pick the best people to do the job to keep this city safe,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;Phil is the best person for this job.&quot;</p><p>The mayor&#x27;s reasoning was similar to his brother&#x27;s appointment, which drew attention from national news outlets.</p><p>Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Adams cited the rise in hate crimes as a reason he was especially concerned about his security. The mayor, who has at times traveled without security, said he still wanted to remain approachable with the public. &quot;I need that right balance,&quot; he said. &quot;My brother has a community affairs background, the balance that I need. He understands law enforcement.&quot;</p><p>Bernard Adams spent two decades in the NYPD. According to his LinkedIn, he most recently served as an assistant director of operations for parking and transportation at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p><p>Jeffrey Fagan, a law professor at Columbia University who studies policing, described the appointment as nepotism. &quot;A parking administrator in a rural southern university has neither the experience nor qualifications for the position,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s hard to imagine that there is not a more well-qualified law enforcement professional in New York City or the nation.&quot;</p>",

She added the policies will &quot;invite violence against police officers and will have deleterious effects on our relationship with the communities we protect.&quot;</p><p>Sewell said she&#x27;s looking to strike a &quot;better balance&quot; between police safety and reform. Bragg, in response, released a statement Saturday saying he’s answering “Sewell’s call for frank and productive discussions to reach common ground on our shared mission to deliver safety and justice for all.” He went on to say he looks &quot;forward to the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings.&quot;</p><p>Bragg and Sewell have already begun contacting one another, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.</p><p>Sewell’s email represents the first public rift between Sewell, the first Black police commissioner, and Bragg, the first Black Manhattan district attorney who framed himself as a <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/what-manhattans-next-top-prosecutor-would-refuse-to-prosecute\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">progressive criminal justice reformer</a> during his campaign. <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/eric-adams-picks-nassau-county-pd-chief-keechant-sewell-be-first-female-nypd-commissioner\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sewell was appointed by Mayor Eric Adams</a>, a retired police captain who ran on the premise in reducing rising crime across the city. Adams said this week he had planned on meeting with Bragg in his official role as mayor.</p><p>In a memo released early this week, Bragg outlined his new policies to reduce charges or stop prosecuting low-level offenses that include trespassing (with exceptions if the case includes a stalking charge), resisting arrest, fare evasion, prostitution, and open-air drug sales.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NewDay/status/1479438878629154820?s=20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In a CNN appearance on Friday</a>, Bragg defended his policy calling the changes “humane and fair.” He said those accused of these low-level offenses will instead be provided services that will help them avoid the criminal justice system in the future.</p><p>&quot;I know from my personal life, and from the research and my prosecution experience this is going to make us safer,&quot; Bragg said.</p><p>Bragg doubled down on his stance during a visit to the National Action Network headquarters in Harlem on Saturday.</p><p>&quot;We were specific. We said we were going to marry fairness and safety, and we laid out a specific plan. We put on the website; we put it in print,&quot; Bragg, who was personally invited by Rev. Al Sharpton, said.</p>",

All must be held accountable for their actions.”</p><p>Additionally, Bragg&#x27;s office will limit their request for pre-trial confinement for the following cases: those charged with either murder, domestic violence, a handful of violent felony offenses, and public corruption cases. In her email, Sewell noted the list does not include those charged with gun possession.</p><p>&quot;The policy appears to not account for recidivist gun offenders and affords people the opportunity to continually possess guns without consequence, especially in light of the directive concerning dispositions, where it does not appear the Manhattan District Attorney will seek sentences involving incarceration in such cases,&quot; Sewell wrote.</p><p>Bragg&#x27;s office said pretrial incarceration will be requested for certain gun possession cases.</p><p>Bragg&#x27;s policies will only apply to those accused of a crime in Manhattan since every borough has its own district attorney.</p><p>Crime so far has ticked up in recent weeks.

The role is considered to be one of the most critical for the Eric Adams administration, which has pledged to focus on reducing crime as a way of helping the city’s economic recovery.</p><p>The appointment was revealed in a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-philip-banks-eric-adams-nypd-20220107-is4fxfskuzcr7pdt4cq5ytphvu-story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Daily News op-ed</a> published Friday morning and written by Banks, who sought to address criticism over his alleged involvement in a 2014 corruption case. Although Banks was never charged with a crime, he was described by federal prosecutors as an “unindicted co-conspirator” in a bribery scandal that extended to Mayor Bill de Blasio and several high-ranking police officials.</p><p>“I still want to serve,” Banks wrote. “But as I take on a new role as deputy mayor for public safety, I owe it to New Yorkers, and to our new Mayor Eric Adams, to answer some questions that have been raised about me.”</p><p>He added that it was “100% false” that he had ever traded favors as an NYPD official. Still, he apologized for his association with two of the de Blasio donors <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/prolific-briber-and-real-fraud-god-jona-rechnitz-sentenced-10-months-fined-10-million\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who were ultimately convicted</a>, Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg. They were later found to have provided gifts and cash to high-ranking officials.</p><p>As the department&#x27;s highest ranking uniformed member, Banks received between $250,000 and $500,000 from the real estate firm owned by Rechnitz, <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160411/civic-center/nypd-chief-received-up-500k-from-developer-eyed-corruption-probe/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to financial disclosure firms</a>. Federal prosecutors said that Banks received a “luxury tour” of Israel with the fraudsters, along with expensive meals, sports tickets, and cash disguised as investments.</p>",

In his Op-ed, Banks said that his decision to retire was unrelated to any federal investigation.</p><p>The 59-year-old has been described as playing a pivotal role behind-the-scenes advising the mayor on law enforcement issues. His brother, David Banks, is the <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/incoming-nyc-schools-chancellor-david-banks-promises-change-coming\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">newly appointed New York City schools chancellor.</a> David Banks’s partner Sheena Wright is the Deputy Mayor for Strategic Initiatives.</p><p>Adams has consistently voiced his support for Banks, calling him “an amazing law enforcement expert” who has had “a great career.”</p><p>Still, it was unclear whether his appointment was assured. The New York Times recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/nyregion/philip-banks-deputy-mayor.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that some of Adams’s advisers were debating over whether to install Banks in another role because of concerns of his past.</p><p>Adams denied his team having any misgivings about having Banks in the role of deputy mayor.</p><p>Recently, former law enforcement officials <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/nyregion/philip-banks-deputy-mayor.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told the Times</a> that Banks’s checkered history might prevent him from obtaining FBI security clearance on issues pertaining to briefings on terrorist threats and other matters.</p><p>One NYPD officer, who requested anonymity to speak freely, told WNYC/Gothamist that Banks’s appointment undermined Adams’ vows to root out misconduct within the police department.</p><p>“If your plan is to change the ‘culture’ of the department, bringing an executive from the old culture seems moronic,” the officer said. “I know cops who have been disciplined for unwillingly associating with criminals. Where is Banks’ punishment?”</p><p>With violent and other serious crimes still above pre-pandemic levels in New York City, Adams has made policing a priority of his mayoralty.</p><p>In December, prior to his swearing in, Adams named Keechant Sewell as the NYPD commissioner. At the time, some <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nypds-first-woman-commissioner-faces-applause-and-skepticism\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">policing experts questioned</a> whether the former Nassau County police chief, would have full control of the department, given the possible role of Banks as public safety boss.</p><p>On Thursday, Adams joined Gov. Kathy Hochul at a press conference where the two <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/adams-and-hochul-announce-agreement-deploy-more-police-subways\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced a plan</a> to address crime and homelessness in the subway station. The mayor said the city would deploy more police officers to walk through the subways.</p><p>“Omnipresence is the key,” Adams said.</p><p>A spokesperson for the mayor’s office, which has yet to release a press release, did not say when the new deputy mayor of public safety would start his job.</p>",

People sleep on the subways when it is their safest last option, especially during a pandemic where COVID cases in shelters are rising. We recommend that NYPD stay out of homeless outreach, and instead that the city and state empower homeless outreach teams to provide basic needs items and then permanent housing. More outreach without more housing is not useful.”</p>",

When officers arrived, they said Pierre refused to show his hands, instead sprinting into a nearby subway station.</p><p>When he emerged from the station, two officers attempted to deploy their stun guns to no effect. Moments later, Pierre was fatally shot by two officers.</p><p>“He ran, literally ran, at one of the officers with the knife in his hand,” NYPD Assistant Chief Michael Kemper said at a press conference earlier this week. “It was at that point where again you hear officers scream to drop the knife and the shots were fired.”</p><p>In response to requests for the body camera footage, the NYPD referred WNYC/Gothamist to a policy that <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/public_information/bwc-release-oo-54-20.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gives the department 30 calendar days</a> to make such footage public.</p><p>A spokesperson for Attorney General Tish James&#x27; Office confirmed the AG was also investigating the incident, but declined to say whether they would share the footage with the family.</p><p>At the press conference, the victim’s brother, Roland Pierre, described his young sibling as “selfless, caring, loving.”</p><p>“My brother wasn’t a criminal, he didn’t run the streets,” the elder Pierre said. “He had issues, but he was the kind of person that if you needed a dollar, he’d give it to you, even if it was his last one.”</p>",

It&#x27;s by far the best reason to get your hands messy, in our opinion. Plus they work equally well as a snack, as a side dish or starter, or heck, give us a large enough platter and that&#x27;s all we need for a meal!</p><p>And if you <i>do</i> need a special excuse to order a whole stack of wings delivered to your home via <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3CQM83j\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Grubhub</a>, just for yourself or for a whole crew, note that March Madness begins this week, which means there are hundreds of hours of exciting college basketball coming up. Why watch your bracket get busted without wings?

Even the more &quot;affordable&quot; big names out there will set you back a couple hundred bucks for a dinner that, let&#x27;s be frank, probably won&#x27;t even fill you up. Ever grabbed a slice on the way home from a 13-piece, $150+ omakase? We sure have.</p><p>But it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way! Sushi--or, more specifically for our purposes here, raw fish in its many guises--can make for a special-feeling and completely satisfying meal without triggering a bunch of financial anxiety. So here is just a small sampling of all the great, more neighborhood-y sushi options in the city. And if you order your dinner via Grubhub, even after generously tipping your deliverista you&#x27;re still going to save money instead of going out, especially if you wash your dinner down with bodega beers.</p>",

That said, our favorite things here are probably Maiko Kyogoku and chef Emily Yuen&#x27;s fantastic Crispy Rice creations, triangles of the chewy, crackling grain piled high with either salmon, spicy tuna, or enoki mushroom and black garlic.
