Jacobs insisted that AOC’s brand of politics would not sell across the state.</p><p>“AOC represents a district that is far more to the left than the rest of the state,” said Jacobs, aligning himself with the positions of President Joe Biden and Gov.

We have real competitive campaigns with Republicans,” said Jacobs. “You don&#x27;t see that in much of New York City. Some areas, yes.

Hillman is also charged with lying about what happened on official paperwork. If she is found guilty, she could serve up to four years behind bars.</p><p>The Department of Correction and the Correction Captains’ Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Prosecutors have said that Hillman filled out paperwork, walked around and ordered staff not to open Wilson’s cell door instead of immediately taking action to save him. In opening statements, they said her delays cost Wilson his life and called her behavior “a gross deviation from the standard of care.”</p><p>But Hillman described a hectic day with various tasks competing for her attention. At the same time, she said, personal grief was distracting her from her work.</p><p>Hillman said she had returned to normal duty just weeks earlier, following the 2019 murder of a close friend whom she considered a sister. The captain testified that she spent almost nine months on medical leave and several more on desk duty, during which she had no contact with detainees. She said the department’s medical staff deemed her unfit for duty after the murder and didn’t clear her to work until July 2020.</p><p>Hillman said the Department of Correction forced her to return to duty before she was ready. While on leave, she said, a department doctor told her the agency was short-staffed and that she had to start working again.</p><p>“I said I wasn’t ready to get back to work, and she said that she didn’t care,” Hillman said.</p><p>Later, when a supervisor told the captain it was time to take her required riflery test, Hillman said that she again resisted.</p><p>“I was extremely scared,” she said, adding, “I told her that it was not a good idea.”</p><p>In the fall of 2020, Hillman returned to full duty. She said she was running six housing units in a facility where she had never worked before her leave and added that she was still learning the layout and getting to know the staff.</p><p>“It was very, very challenging,” she said.</p><p>Hillman said that she wasn’t given any refresher courses after about a year away from her normal duties. She also said that she had never received suicide prevention training. Less than a fifth of city correction officers took a required suicide prevention class between Sept. 1, 2021 and Sept. 20, 2022, <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/amid-high-suicide-rates-at-rikers-correction-officers-arent-completing-suicide-prevention-courses\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gothamist reported</a> last year.</p><p>During cross-examination, prosecutors said they had found records showing that Hillman had attended suicide prevention trainings in 2014, 2015 and 2018. Hillman said that she did not recall those trainings and that DOC records are not always accurate.</p><p>Prosecutors also noted that Hillman had written on official paperwork requesting bereavement leave that her friend was her “sister.” When an assistant district attorney asked Hillman how she defined the word “sister,” she broke down crying on the stand and gasped for breath.</p><p>Yoran pressed the captain on her leave from work, suggesting in her questions that she had intentionally misrepresented her relationship with her friend to get the leave, and if she had gotten special treatment. Hillman denied both.</p><p>Rampant absenteeism has plagued the city’s Department of Correction for years and has contributed to dire conditions in the jails. Correction officers receive unlimited sick time — a perk that some jail staff have abused, especially at the height of the pandemic. Three employees recently pleaded guilty to federal charges for vacationing, partying and doing home improvements while faking sick.</p><p></p><h4><b>‘I knew I had to work’</b></h4><p>On Nov. 22, 2020, Hillman was overseeing multiple housing units, including Wilson’s. According to prosecutors, the captain was planning to move Wilson because of an altercation with another man in detention. While waiting to be transferred, Wilson allegedly told an officer that he was going to kill himself and then took steps to do so.</p><p>Prosecutors said the officer asked Hillman to come right away, but that she waited. After she arrived, they said, she ordered staff not to open Wilson’s cell door and waited another 15 minutes to call for medical help. Prosecutors also alleged that she said Wilson was fine and that he was “playing.” They called her “heartless.”</p><p>Hillman challenged the state’s version of what happened.</p><p>As surveillance footage played on a screen at the front of the courtroom, Hillman walked through the moments leading up to Wilson’s death, explaining what she was doing and why. At step after step, Hillman said she was unaware of an emergency or had no reason to think that anything out of the ordinary was happening. She said an officer had told her that he’d heard from someone in custody that Wilson was hanging in his cell, but she said that neither she nor the officer believed it.</p><p>Hillman said that people in jail regularly tell her that they are going to kill themselves, so that she will take their requests seriously. But in this case, she said, Wilson had not threatened to take his life in front of her. She said he seemed calm when she told him earlier in the afternoon that he was being moved and that she didn’t think that it would cause any sort of emergency.</p><p>When Hillman met an officer outside Wilson’s cell and learned that there was a sheet wrapped around his neck, she said, she never ordered the officer not to cut it. The captain said she still didn’t think anything was wrong, because Wilson’s feet looked like they were flat on the ground. Surveillance footage showed that a crowd of incarcerated people had gathered in the hallway.</p><p>After several more minutes, someone opened the cell door. That’s when Hillman said she felt like “something’s not right.” She said she told Wilson to come down, and that he didn’t respond. Then, she said, she told the officer to cut the sheet.</p><p>Hillman called for a doctor and ordered the officer to perform CPR. Wilson was pronounced dead soon after.</p><p>After medical staff arrived, Hillman said, she tried to comfort the officer and “get the facts out.” She denied that she told him to write anything specific in a report about the incident. Hillman said she then went to the captain’s lounge and cried.</p><p>“I just fell apart,” she said.</p><p>Hillman was temporarily suspended and is now on modified duty at the Anna M. Kross Center on Rikers Island. She does not interact with people in detention. Hillman also testified in court that was written up twice before for a DOC charge called “insufficient performance of duties.” She lost <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/city-jail-captain-accused-standing-during-suicide-was-disciplined-failing-intervene-prior-incident\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">four vacation days</a> in one case and the other is still pending.</p><p><i>If someone you know exhibits</i> <a href=\"https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/suicide-warning-signs\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>warning signs of suicide</i></a><i>: do not leave the person alone; remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt; call or text 988 or chat at</i> <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>988lifeline.org</i></a><i>;</i> <i>take the person to an emergency room; or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.</i></p><p><i>This story has been updated. </i></p>",

I think we could kind of do this. What if we just keep the furniture pushed away and we make it a rehearsal space and we just do this here?’”</p><p>Eventually they built out a theater inside a studio apartment, complete with a grid for lighting equipment and risers for seating. That’s where Gridley put on his stage adaptation of “Miss Julie.”</p><p>“The stage manager and I called the show from our bed,” Gridley said.</p><p>Their current apartment — a large, windowless box of a room with a corner kitchen, a small living area and an attached bedroom — eventually became available.

Alright.’ And so we rehearsed this one little moment at like 8 a.m.”</p><p>The dedication beamed through with each rehearsal. The lighting changed with each scene — yellow for when the main character experiences a flashback to Iraq and a shade of purple when she’s home. Music and strange, unsettling noises blared during intense war memories.</p><p>These subtle details were the result of having access to a stage complete with lighting and sound design equipment throughout the writing and workshopping process.

Gridley and Treadway obliged.</p><p>“It was a really nice, intimate feeling,” Osorio said. “It was really important to put it up in front of an audience to see what jokes land, what do people get, what do they not get.”</p>",

It will run in the <a href=\"https://freshfruitfestival.com/23-main/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fresh Fruit Festival</a> in May.</p><p>“[One thing] I&#x27;m super excited about being able to offer to other people is for them to be able to se their play, not in just a wooden room with chairs around with everybody lit, but focused with theatrical lighting on the actor,” Gridley said. “It&#x27;s [got] good sound and you can have some effects in things like that. I think it really helps playwrights.”</p>",

It is not contingent on what Vornado was planning in the entire neighborhood.”</p><p>The Penn Station project has been years in the making and was first championed by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>Under the original plan, Vornado was set to build 10 high-rise towers in the areas surrounding Penn Station in exchange for more than $1 billion in tax breaks. The developer would then make payments in lieu of taxes to help fund the Penn redevelopment.</p><p>But since then, interest rates have increased and the COVID pandemic reshaped demand for office space, leading Vornado to suggest it would pause its plans <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/penn-station-developer-backs-off-22-billion-project-after-years-working-behind-the-scenes-with-ny-governor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first in November</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/nyregion/vornado-penn-station-project.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">again last month</a>. That led state Sen. Leroy Comrie, a Queens Democrat who chairs the Senate committee overseeing the MTA, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x6s8O5B-5Q&amp;t=5767s\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">declare the project “dead and moot” last week</a>, calling it a “ridiculous plan which we already know is dead three different ways.”</p><p>Hochul gave no indication of what her “alternate plan” to fund the Penn Station project would entail. She’s currently in the <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/ny-gov-hochuls-budget-money-for-asylum-seekers-schools-mta-and-more\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">midst of state budget negotiations with lawmakers</a>, with a final spending plan due before April 1.</p><p>“My plan is simply to give New York commuters an experience that is not equated to a living hell, OK?” Hochul said on WNYC. “They deserve to have a beautiful, light-filled, uplifting experience when they arrive at Penn Station — our commuters, our residents and our visitors.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Hochul also continued to tout her proposed housing plan, which she claims would create 800,000 new units over the next decade.</p><p>The bulk of Hochul’s plan is centered on requiring each city, town and village to meet certain goals — a 3% increase in the housing stock over the next three years for communities in the MTA service area, and 1% elsewhere. If a community doesn’t hit the mark, the state could step in and approve residential development projects, which has many suburban town supervisors crying foul.</p><p>Hochul said she’s not concerned about <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochuls-ambitious-housing-plan-meets-suburban-blockade\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the political blowback from her plan</a>, which has stirred up significant criticism on Long Island — where she recently lost both counties in her successful 2022 election bid.</p><p>“I’ve heard all the threats,” she said. “I knew this was not going to be easy. If it was easy, someone would have done it long before.”</p><p>Already, Republican officials in suburban counties — including Rockland County Executive Ed Day — have threatened to sue to stop Hochul’s plan if lawmakers approve it, arguing that it would unconstitutionally usurp local control. But Hochul said she’s confident her plan “will meet legal muster.”</p><p>“We crafted it in a way that gives flexibility to communities, and we’re just telling them to meet certain growth targets any way that they choose to,” she said.</p>",

And everybody who&#x27;s over 65 imagines themselves in that group, even if they&#x27;re not [currently] in that group.”</p><p>Caress said she is enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan herself because, for her, it is cheaper than paying for supplemental coverage under traditional Medicare.

She said she has been trying to get councilmembers to introduce legislation prohibiting the administration from “diminishing” retirees’ benefits, including by shifting them onto a Medicare Advantage plan.</p><p>Councilmember Carmen de la Rosa, who initially introduced the bill to change the city code to allow retirees to pay to stay on SeniorCare, did not respond to a request for comment on whether the Council would take up the issue again.</p><p><i>This story was updated with quotes from Municipal Labor Committee members, a comment from Mayor Adams and details on Thursday’s vote.</i> </p>",

But this year he launched a personal side project on Instagram called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/Manhatoon/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Manhatoon</a>, for which he draws iconic local businesses and landmarks — like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CpBea_cNaCq/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ray’s Candy Store</a>, Chinatown Fair and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CoyGK0EraoW/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Balloon Saloon</a> — then animates the illustrations and adds sound.</p><p>He’s one of a growing number of New Yorkers who have set out to document and preserve an ever-changing city through DIY projects spread via social media, particularly Instagram. Their creations are love letters to a city that is still only beginning to emerge from the trauma of the pandemic. And in some cases, their efforts bolster an urban landscape where rising rents endanger longtime businesses beloved by locals.</p>",

He’s also gained the admiration of store owners who frequently repost his work.</p><p>“I lived on top of Ivan Ramen for three years of my life,” he said, “and it was really nice when Ivan himself sent me a DM thanking me for the animation.”</p><p>Aguirre joins a crowded field of photographers, cartoonists, tinkerers and artists engaged in similarly inspired visual projects.

He would take his daughters on trips downtown during that spring as part of their pandemic routine. They couldn’t actually enter a lot of stores, so he instead started drawing some of their favorite places, starting <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAaSiEnBzNe/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">with Economy Candy</a>.</p><p>“I drew that and I&#x27;m like, ‘Hey kids, we can&#x27;t go in here, but isn&#x27;t this cool?&#x27;” Holland said. “I posted that on Instagram, and I got kind of addicted to it.”</p><p>Since then, he has made more than 700 drawings, about 225 of which were featured in his book <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710994/nyc-storefronts-by-joel-holland-and-david-dodge/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“NYC Storefronts: Illustrations of the Big Apple&#x27;s Best-Loved Spots,”</a> which was released last fall. That book focused on Manhattan stores, and he’s currently working on a follow-up looking at Brooklyn shops.</p><p>Holland grew up in Pennsylvania, but has lived in the city since 1998. He thinks the fact that he’s not a native New Yorker is one reason why he’s so driven to document this place.</p><p>“I&#x27;m so psyched that I still live here, that I can live here, and I&#x27;m trying to hug all of it as much as possible,” he said. “I feel like in New York, you&#x27;re always hustling, you&#x27;re crawling on the sidewalks to stay alive. And in a way, it&#x27;s seeing other businesses and people do the same thing that keeps me active.”</p>",

The Gravesend resident worked for a chemical manufacturing company until the start of the pandemic, when he started spending more time working on 3-D printing. Now, his full-time job is <a href=\"http://www.majorminis.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Major Minis</a>, where he designs and manufactures miniature storefront models of New York spaces.</p><p>Giambanco’s father owned pizzerias, so he saw the difficulties of running small businesses up close. He naturally empathized with struggling mom-and-pop shops during this period of contraction.</p><p>“I know what it&#x27;s like, the heartache that the owners go through,” Giambanco said. “To see places closed down during a pandemic, or people struggling, it touched me. I came up with an idea one day of using my talents to capture these places and create miniatures of them, and kind of memorialize them forever, and give them to the owners of the places.”</p><p>Although he had operated 3-D printers since 2014, it took Giambanco months to perfect his own methodology. Now it takes about a week to create each model – and he takes requests from fans.</p><p>“To know that all the time I&#x27;ve put into learning my craft, to know that this storefront that I&#x27;m creating for somebody is going to touch them deeply, it makes me want to go on,” he said. “And what better place than the city that we live in? There&#x27;s so many stories in these storefronts and these businesses, these little subcultures that we can all learn about and that you don&#x27;t wanna lose. These places actually define us as people.”</p>",

He’s become the patron saint of the city’s most eccentric characters and an encyclopedia of New York personalities. He uses his wildly popular Instagram account to highlight unsung locals and promote endangered small businesses.</p><p>“Preservation is the main thing,” he said. “I think it&#x27;s important to keep it going in everyday conversation. And that was my mission from the very jump.”</p><p>Heller posits that New York’s urban aesthetics and abundance of classic signage suits these kinds of projects. “A lot of these storefronts have a ton of character and are fun to look at,” he said, “so that lends itself well to photographs or illustrations or models.”</p><p>Among his own inspirations was the work of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamesandkarla/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">James and Karla Murray</a>, a husband-and-wife team of photographers who have been documenting the eradication of local stores for decades. Their landmark 2008 book, “Store Front: The Disappearing Face of New York,” is in many ways a precursor to all these archival projects, including Heller’s unique, gritty vision.</p><p>&quot;I loved how they were documenting all these storefronts and not only was it visually appealing, it also told a story,&quot; Heller said. “I used it myself as a guide of places that I wanted to check out.&quot;</p><p>Aguirre, the Manhatoon creator, says what he thinks ultimately unites all these disparate artists is how deeply they identify with their surroundings.</p><p>“New York City gives you a sense of belonging,” he says. “There are so many people from all over the world here, but New York is <i>their</i> city. Whenever I go back to Mexico, I call New York City home. I plan to probably die here, you know what I mean?”</p>",

As such, many people may have some immunity to XBB.1.5, which the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/multi-media/details/who-press-conference-on-global-health-issues---4-january-2023\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">described on Jan. 4</a> as the most transmissible subvariant of omicron to date. </p><p>The global health agency also stated that XBB.1.5 doesn’t yet appear more severe than past variants, a claim that was supported by <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7208a4.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent research from the New York City health department</a>. </p>",
