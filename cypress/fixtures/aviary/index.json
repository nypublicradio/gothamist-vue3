                            "value": "<p>In his fourth – and potentially final – State of the City address, an embattled Mayor Eric Adams committed to investing $650 million to support people experiencing homelessness and severe mental illness. The pledge is part of a suite of proposed investments Adams unveiled Thursday with an eye to New York City families and their uncertainty moving forward.</p><p>“There’s no denying that New Yorkers are anxious about the future,” Adams said. “Extreme costs are forcing too many people, especially working-class families, to make hard choices: between groceries or child care, medicine or clothing, making the rent or moving out.”</p><p>The Democratic incumbent faces his own uncertain future: His federal corruption trial is set to begin in April and he faces a crowded field of challengers for his primary in June. Many of his constituents remain concerned about the city’s rising cost of living and a perception of instability driven by high-profile crimes, visible street homelessness and the city’s struggles to accommodate arriving migrants.</p><p>The address delivered at Harlem&#x27;s historic Apollo Theatre was Adams’ opportunity to offer his administration’s antidote to these challenges. He said the city would add 900 so-called Safe Haven beds, which serve as alternative housing to larger congregate shelter facilities for people experiencing homelessness. He also pledged to open a new support facility that will offer psychiatric and substance abuse care.</p><p>Part of the mayor’s strategy hinges on whether <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-looks-to-expand-forced-hospitalization-as-albany-returns-to-session\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">state legislators pass a law</a> that makes it easier for the city to forcibly hospitalize people deemed mentally ill. Advocates for civil liberties and homeless New Yorkers have historically opposed the idea, saying that such legislation merely seeks to sweep aside vulnerable New Yorkers and doesn’t address the need for additional housing and mental health resources.</p><p>The mayor also pointed to the cycle of childhood poverty and vowed to launch a pilot program that would connect families expecting children who were applying for shelter with services to help families find and secure permanent housing.</p><p>“No child should ever be born into our shelter system,” Adams said.</p><p>He also took the opportunity to tout one of his signature victories: an <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/mayor-adams-5-billion-housing-plan-to-reshape-nyc-approved-by-city-council\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">overhaul of the city zoning code</a> that aims to make it easier to build housing. Adams said the city would build 800 units of housing alongside a new library on the Upper West Side, one of the city’s most expensive neighborhoods. He pledged 100,000 new homes in Manhattan alone as part of the city’s decadelong initiative to add 1 million new housing units.</p><p>“From the brownstones in Harlem to the high rises in Midtown, we will say ‘yes’ to more housing and ‘yes’ to a more family-friendly city,” Adams said, referring to his “City of Yes” plan, the linchpin of his housing strategy.</p><p>The mayor also announced more money to clean city parks, which had been among the targets of unpopular budget cuts during his administration. The city will add an extra cleaning shift to at least 100 parks, he said.</p><p>Adams said the city would also open more schoolyards to the public in underserved areas so that more New Yorkers could be within a 10-minute walk from a park.</p><p>Still, the unspecified extra funding will likely fall short of the demands of parks advocates, who have criticized Adams for failing to fulfill his promise to double the city’s parks budget.</p><p>As part of the traditionally ceremonial event, Adams&#x27; speech was preceded by nearly an hour of prayers from the city’s faith leaders and musical performances including a local city drumline. The mayor also paid tribute to Jimmy Carter, the nation’s 39th president, whose funeral was held on the same day as the speech.</p><p>Adams praised Carter as “a true public servant, a leader and humanitarian full of hope and compassion for his fellow man.”</p><p>Later, the mayor referenced the corruption charges against him, which he has vigorously denied.</p><p>“There were some who said step down,” Adams said. “I said, no, I’m gonna step up.”</p>",

The email may link to fraudulent websites whose URLs contain strange numbers or symbols, and the message or site may include obvious spelling errors.</p><p>In addition to trying to trick victims into sending them payments directly, scammers may also try to trick drivers into disclosing their passwords, login information for legitimate sites, PINs, Social Security numbers, or bank or credit card information, according to Tolls by Mail New York.</p><p>A link in a message from a scammer may also include part of a real company or agency name, but it will not go to the legitimate site for that company.</p><h4><b>How to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>pay for tolls</b></h4><p>All MTA Bridges and Tunnels tolling facilities use cashless systems, meaning scanners will either charge drivers&#x27; E-ZPasses automatically or register their license plates so that they can receive a bill in the mail.</p><p>Tolls by Mail New York handles online payments for the MTA, New York State Thruway Authority and Port Authority at <a href=\"https://www.tollsbymailny.com/vector/videotolls/invoices/invoiceInquiry.do?locale=en_US&amp;from=Home\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TollsByMailNY.com</a>. Drivers who are unsure if a message demanding payment is real can go directly to that site to check, instead of clicking a potentially suspicious link.</p><p>Drivers can also pay bills by mail, via phone at 844-826-8400, or <a href=\"https://www.tollsbymailny.com/vector/videotolls/invoices/storeLocator.do\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in person</a> at certain locations by using a check, credit or debit card, bank account, or cash.</p><p>Still, the MTA notes that mailed tolls are less convenient and more expensive than E-ZPass, since E-ZPass comes with a <a href=\"https://new.mta.info/tolls/how-to-pay-tolls#:~:text=Vehicles%20that%20use%20one%20of,through%20the%20Tolls%20NY%20app.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">25% discount</a>.

JRT’s status as a woman-owned firm allowed Cushman to obtain contracts with diversity requirements. But the lawsuit claims Cushman sidelined JRT and attempted to “destroy” its reputation after Hamilton asked them to give the city’s account to Diana Boutross.</p><p>The city’s agreement with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, one of two firms handling its commercial real estate deals, expired on Nov. 19, 2024, <a href=\"https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/RequestDetail/20231229109\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to city contract data</a>. DCAS has not yet requested bids for a new contract.</p><p>Restler said the city should seek new brokers expeditiously, and bar Hamilton from participating in the process.</p><p>“The new contract should set transparent and explicit standards for expertise required,” along with goals for hiring minority- and women-owned businesses, known as MWBEs, “to end the corruption involving the Adams administration and its cronies,” Restler said.</p><p>In response to an inquiry, JRT attorney Carmine Castellano pointed to the text of the <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=OMMmGm/EVF8ixfVwzkb4Tw==\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a>, but said the city “should rebid the contract.”</p><p>In an emailed statement, Cushman &amp; Wakefield spokesperson Michael Boonshoft said “any change in our work with JRT was driven by the city’s amended requirements for working with MWBE businesses, as well as other legitimate commercial reasons.”</p><p>Boonshoft did not respond to a question about whether the accusations could affect Cushman’s future city contracts.</p><p>A DCAS spokesperson said the agency expects to issue a request for contract proposals from brokerages later this year. Agency spokespeople declined to comment on the substance of JRT’s complaint.</p><p>It accuses Cushman of attempting to “eliminate JRT as competition in the upcoming procurement process for the new contract.”</p><p>The lawsuit also claims Cushman sought to monopolize commissions on city leases or purchases, including a plan to acquire a 1.3-million-square-foot warehouse facility in the Bronx. Hamilton has faced scrutiny for <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/top-nyc-real-estate-official-faces-new-scrutiny-over-bronx-warehouse-deal\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">appearing in a promotional video</a> for the facility while the city was negotiating to lease or buy it, in a deal that could have resulted in a potential $13.4 million commission for Boutross.</p><p>The suit represents the latest controversy involving Hamilton and his dealings as head of city real estate.</p><p>Investigators from the Manhattan district attorney’s office <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/03/adams-aide-phone-seized-00182376\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confronted</a> Hamilton and seized his phone in October 2024 after he returned from a trip to Japan with Boutross and other associates, including former top mayoral advisor Ingrid Lewis-Martin.</p><p>Beyond the Bronx warehouse plans, Hamilton and DCAS have faced questions about nixing an office agreement for the city’s Department for the Aging and instead <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/23/jesse-hamilton-eric-adams-city-lease-deal-donor-billionaire-00185118\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">renting space from a billionaire Adams donor.</a></p><p>Hamilton and Boutross did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking comment.</p>",

The tally on Monday was 39 against and 1 not voting.</p><p>Opponents of the sprawling plan, which partners Wynn New York City with developer Related, said Tuesday they hoped the community board’s vote would spur others to reject the mixed-use development, which also includes market-rate and affordable housing, a public park and a new K-8 school.</p><p>The Wynn project, which would overlook the Hudson River, is <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/high-stakes-nyc-casino-race-heats-up-as-projects-vie-for-approval-in-2025\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of 11 casino projects</a> that have been proposed by competing entities across the city and adjacent suburbs. Applications to the state Gaming Commission are due in June, with the expected announcement of as many as three licenses by the end of the year.</p><p>Joe Restuccia, a board member who voted against the Wynn casino, said it would have resulted in far less housing than what the developer had earlier promised and left parks in the area in the shadow of new high-rises.</p><p>“The last time we voted an outright denial was 1986, so it takes a lot for our community board on the West Side to say we don’t approve it at all,” said Restuccia, who co-chairs Community Board 4’s housing committee.</p><p>Natalie Ravitz, a spokesperson for Related, said many community suggestions were “not fiscally feasible to implement” but added that the company welcomed further feedback.</p><p>“We are focused on moving forward with local elected officials, who have been committed to pursuing realistic plans that deliver the jobs, housing and community improvements New York needs today,” Ravitz said.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wynnnewyorkcity.com/careers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wynn New York City</a>, the development could generate as many as 35,000 union construction jobs along with more than 5,000 unionized employees in permanent jobs.</p><p>The backers <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/a-jobs-boon-from-a-casino-at-manhattans-hudson-yards-experts-arent-betting-on-it\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enlisted</a> community advocates to help sell the project&#x27;s merits to the public. Leaders from the NAACP, National Urban League and Win, New York City&#x27;s largest provider of family shelter and permanent supportive housing, are among the initiative&#x27;s supporters.</p><p>Representatives of those groups have said the proposal would bring much-needed jobs, including for poor and working-class New Yorkers. Christine Quinn, the head of Win and a former City Council speaker, spoke of “thousands of jobs for homeless moms.”</p><p>But Restuccia said the community board soured on the project. He said significant rollbacks had occurred since a 2009 agreement forged with Related, which he said had offered 5,700 units of housing. The latest proposal offered 1,500 units, including 324 units of affordable housing.</p><p>Those changes helped drive a petition <a href=\"https://protect.thehighline.org/about\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opposing</a> the project dubbed Protect the High Line at the Rail Yards. A spokesperson for the opposition said the petition had 3,400 signatories as of Tuesday.</p><p>Alan van Capelle, the executive director of Friends of the High Line, which maintains the elevated park that abuts Hudson Yards, said the project’s backers were “tone deaf.”</p><p>“We&#x27;re in the middle of a housing crisis, and this plan takes away much needed housing,” van Capelle said. “There has to be better use for this land that&#x27;s owned by the people of New York than what&#x27;s being proposed.”</p>",
